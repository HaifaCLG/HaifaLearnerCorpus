Last month my family and I celebrated Pesah. My mother cooked and I helped her to put the food on the table, and the rest of my family: my father and my sister didn't help.
Friend of the family came to celebrate with us. The celebrating wasn't very interesting. We were eating, and after that each of us was doing something else: I was sitting on computer, serfe in internet.
I remember that my father and the friend of the family started an argument about her age, and that was so funny that she forgot her age. I was laughing a lot after it. and all the family was laughing. After it, everybody went to his own place and the celebrating finished.
