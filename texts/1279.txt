The most important thing for me right now, is to finish all the Bagrut examinations.  In the next months, I will need to work very hard if I want to succeed.  This year is the most important year in my life.  It has influence on my life.  Actually, I don't really know what to do with my future after I'll finish this year.  That is because I haven't done any decisions yet.  (In one thing I'm definitely sure) I'll be so relieved.  After the examinations will over, I'll be calm and peaceful â€“ no more stress!  Then I can organize my life as I've wanted.  There would be time for fun, sleeping late, "old" plans, etc.  My life will change for the first time.  I'll have freedom, independence and more self-confidence.  Everything I want, I need to get it by myself.  For the first time in my life I'll be on my own.  I'm the one who decide how to manage her life, and in which way.
