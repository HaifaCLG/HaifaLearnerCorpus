Dear Dan!
As you know, I had my birthday two weeks a go and I want to tell you about my parent's present.
My own parents gave me 5,000$ for my birthday and now I will tell you what I want to do with all the money.
First of all I bought a new bike and now I left 4,000$. My dream is to go to eilat but I think I will save the money and use it when I will be older. I want you to give me your opinion abot the money.
I miss you and I hope to see you soon...
