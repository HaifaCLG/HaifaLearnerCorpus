Overcrowding in the classroom is a problem in many schools.  Many solution had arisen but I want to share with you one solution that has been suggested.  It was the class be split and taught in two shifts.  On the one hand it's a great solution, the pupils can enjoy space in the classrooms and can understand the teacher more than they can understand her in a full classroom.  I can concentrate more because there isn't so much noise.  But on the other hand many pupils prefer to study in the morning so they can enjoy from the afternoon to do these things.  For example, go shopping, help mother in the house and do homework.

In my opinion, other solution must come up because it's very uncomfortable to come to school on the afternoon when you can arrive in the morning and finish with this early.
