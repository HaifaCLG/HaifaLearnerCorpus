Hi James, How are you? I'am fine.
Before couple of days I had a birthday party with all my family and my freinds. After everybody go I count all the money that I got and I have 200$ I still didn't do anythign withe the money buy I want to buy a new guitar and new amp cause my enqiment is starting to be old. But I have two options, or buy a new enqiment for my guitar or buy a new computer and some big lcd. I guess I going to buy the new guitar cause I have a cool computer and TV and I really want to buy some new guitar and amps.
So James what you was doing insted of me?
Well I have to go now, happy to hear from you.
