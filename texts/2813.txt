In October I celebrate my bar mitzva. I want to eveary at the .Mozzkin sinygog who every body I know was there. It's friends, family and other. My rabi was sanding next to me when I read rom the Tora. When I finish reading every body were throwing candies on me and one of my firnds hit my rabi in the glasses . After the "lunch" at the sinygog, we went to a resturant. My father was the "host" of the event. I was sitting at the resturant near my brothers and one relaited. When I got home me and my familly opend the MAATAFOT and started counting the money. I got about 9900 shekels.
