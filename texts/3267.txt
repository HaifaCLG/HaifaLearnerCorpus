Dear Shlomo,
You wouldn't believe me, but I just got 10,000 dollars for my birthday from a rich uncle.
I bought a special skatebord and started doing some cool tricks, but I am little scared because I saw on the internet videoes of people smash their face after they fell or broke their bones so I think about something elese, less dangerous, but I have nothing in my mind. Could you help me?
