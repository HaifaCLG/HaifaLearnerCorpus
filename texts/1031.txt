The most unexpected thing that happened to me was when I once went to Tel Aviv to buy some thing and then when I got in to Tel Aviv with the bus I saw a car I love the most. This car can be seen only abroad and the man with the car came to Israel only once. A few minutes later when I was in town I saw from our car in the other side of the road behind the bushes the car and then I saw it again. Later on I saw it once again and then the man went back abroad. though I don't want to write I'll try to add this is a car that is made in Italy by a very good factory this factory was bought lately by another factory and its not good for the first one, so I hope that they will leave that factory.
