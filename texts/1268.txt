I am going to talk in this passage about my disagreement about the solution that has been suggested.  The solution is about splitting classes and teaching them in two shifts because of the big amount of children in each class.

There are people who will say that this suggestion is good because in every shift there are less children that in one shift.  They think that in this way the children will study better.

But I disagree with that solution because I think that the children who will study in the shift in the morning will study better than the shift in the afternoon.  Moreover, the teacher can't teach all day long and I think that she'll teach the second group not good as the first group.
