The date is January 1994. Its 9.30 in the evening and we finished our shift. Now its bad time but we don't have to go to school, so are seating a few friends together and talking about everything. Suddenly Amit said: I miss the great time that we had at school. Everybody were quiet, it seems that we were thinking about it to. I felt that I should start talking about that, because everybody were embarrassed. I said; school was really boring to me, bit I suppose it could be fun as well. It seems like everybody agreed with me. Amit said: I'll give everything to get back to the old time that we were in school. Its much better than being in that shit. Everybody were smiling because they felt exactly the way I feel. Yoram said: do you remember the times that the teachers throw us out and we were very ashamed. But now if we are making something bad the commander tell us to run around the base. I miss school. Yaniv told us that he was a good student and the teachers liked him very much. His report grade card was very good that what he said. My grade card I said was very bad, but I wasn't expecting for something better. Yossi said, if I'm looking back I can see that I like school. I said: I think that the 12 years went to fast and I think that I could suffer a few more. I finished my words, everybody closed their eyes and went to sleep with good memories about school.
