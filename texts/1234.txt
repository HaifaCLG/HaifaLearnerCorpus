The boy is sitting, at home, and day dreaming and thinking about his addiction.

Sometimes he is in a great mood and often he feels bad.

He is addicted to drugs and therefore he hates his life.  The boy wants to run away.

He closes his eyes.  One moment he feels as if he’s on top on the world.  He is king of the universe.  After a while the boy opens his eyes.  A tear is running down his cheek.  He is thinking about his addiction, and about his friends, and he shouts:  I must stop my addiction, I need to be friendly, and I must be better.

In spite of his positive thoughts he feels sad because he doesn’t really know how to stop his addiction.
