It is nice to learn foreign language because you can understand what the other side said. Now what to do when you want to learn foreign language?



I think to pass the particular confusing you must at first to know the basic roles of the language such as little grammar and to know words. I advise person who want to learn any language, listen to news, song, read stories, magazines …



Now I want to tell you my dear reader my experience of learning an Italian language. The story began when my uncle was learning medicine in Italy before he finished her study branch told us that get marry with girl from Rome university we agreed with him. After they married we was invited them to our house to dinner or to drink coffee, tea.



One day I asked my uncle to tell her wife that I want to teach her Arabic language. She agreed with me and firstly I taught her the letters how to write and how to spell, after that when she get strong began read words and she was so glad that know our language. After that I told him that I want to learn an Italian language I can’t imagine how much she was happy.



She did with me like I did with him. I began to learn the letters, it was so easy because it similar to the spell at English with some difference.


Next I began to study little grammar and to read some words, read stories, make dialogue, listen to music et…



When they get a little and had some baby and when he was 2 years, I get more stronger at the language when I was asked her about some words that I didn’t understood them from the dialogue with her mother, also I get more and more stronger when relatives from Italy came to visit. All the time I was spoke at Italy with them and they was very happy and glad that I get know their language fast and they asked me to visit their country.





Finally:

I want to say that I take the person that he/she that want to study a foreign language a good idea if they find some confusing and how can those difficulties be overcome !!
