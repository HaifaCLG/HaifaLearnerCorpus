In the white snow of the dark night an image dressed in white was seen!  It was the verger!  Dadam!  This is Daniel Glickman reminding you that there is a touch of evil in all of us.  Goodnight, and pleasant dreams, now seriously.

The sheriff sat in his office, bored half to death.  How come there is never anything for a sheriff to do in this little town called Smallville.  The telephone rang.  He lingered slowly towards it and lifted it up.  Yes? he said my cat climbed up the Empire State Building and it can’t get down.  Come help me quick!  A bunch of people were gathered around the Empire State Building looking at the helpless cat.  But then, it’s a bird.  It’s a plane.  It’s Mighty Mouse, grabbed the cat in the nick of time and gave it to  its owner.  From the clear blue of the western sky, who is it – Sky King.
