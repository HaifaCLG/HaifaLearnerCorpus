It happened 5 years ago my friend Ayal got a dog in his 11 birthday from his uncle he was very happy to get a dog. The dog was little he was a baby. Ayal take care of the dog and they bought were happy. After 2 years the dog was very big. And a lot of people were afraid of him. Then Ayal had to keep the dog in a little cage. The dog got mad of being in a cage all the day after three month Ayal decided to take him to a walk . The dog was very happy to get out he started to run in the village like crazy he look for something to eat and he found something it was poison at ate some of it and after 20 minutes he fell down. Ayal took him to the hospital very fast and the doctor save him. After 2 days he put the dog back in the cage. After 2 month the dog run away he saw our neighbor and he bit her 6 times. She screamed a lot and we take her very fast to the hospital my father took the dog and put him in has cage. After a day Ayal's sister wanted to give the dog food she open the cage and the dog bit her in her arm. We took her to the hospital too and we gave the dog to the army to be a guard dog.
