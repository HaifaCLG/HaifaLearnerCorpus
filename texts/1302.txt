In my classroom there is a table which is covered with blue tablecloth which is decorated with fringes.

On this table there are amazing items. The most beautiful item above the table is a silver vase which is full with yellow and green flowers, this vase is in the end of the table, but in front of it there is a white candle in a colorful candle holder which is made of glasses.  To the left I can see a silver butter dish and in front of it there is a knife and under it there is a pink napkin, under the napkin there is a white plate.
