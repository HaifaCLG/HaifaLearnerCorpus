Hi Chen,
How are you? I'm fine if you're wondering.
I'm writing this letter because I wanted to tell you about the amazing thing that happened to me yesterday.
For my birthday, my grandmother decided to do me a surprise.
She gave me 5000 shekels to buy everything I want.
I've already spent 200 shekels on a neckless that I have shown you before.
I bet you're wondering what I'm going to do with the rest of the money.
In an answere to you question, I've thought that we would go to Eilat with all our freinds.
I'm also thinking to buy a leptop because my old computer is "dying".
Maybe I'll do them both.
What do you think I should do with the money?
Answere it like it was yours.
Yours,...
