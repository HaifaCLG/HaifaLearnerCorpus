Radio, television, computer, you name it, technology is making our life much more easy every day.  There isn’t even one single person who if not depending on technology in one way or another.  Furthermore, it is reachable to everyone.  We count on the technology to make our homework, as navigating in the Internet, to know what is happening in this crazy world, as watching the news, to fill our free time listening to the music in the radio.  There are plenty of things we do.  Everyone uses technology for this one task on goals.  Moreover, there are people who need to be familiar with it, because of their jobs.  In the same way, technology has taken from us many jobs.  Now, we have machines doing what in the past humans did.  However, this is a phenomenon which we cannot stop.

To sum up, I have to say that I support technology and all what is it about.  If you don’t try, you won’t see how good is it.
