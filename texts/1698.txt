If I was required for a metaphor that would best describe Israeli society, I would say that it resembles a melting pot more than it does a salad bowl. During the last 57 years as an established state, Israel has constantly molded a society that aspires to be western, even Americanized, with some authentic guidelines and conventions, such as the IDF, which are generally followed by most Israelis.

People of numerous origins are populating Israel, yet the tendency to appear American or European seems to be shared by almost everyone. The MTV culture appears to be the musical and cultural arena of young Israelis, the same way in which American films and TV series, such as “Nip-tack” and “Frustrated housewives” reflect the cultural arena of many grown-ups in Israel. This tendency of Israelis to Americanize is cross-cultural and common to all backgrounds and origins.

The necessity of the IDF and everyone’s obligation to serve in it is one of Israel’s strongest taboos, despite the army’s relatively deteriorating status today. Despite the fact that today, more than in any other period in Israel’s history, many young people find different ways to give up on the army service, serving the state as a soldier in the IDF is still perceived by society as one of the most important duties Israelis need to perform. This perception is common to the majority of Israeli people, regardless of their ethnical backgrounds.

In conclusion, many factors distinguish between Israelis amongst themselves, yet I would describe the Israeli society as a melting pot, since I think that the lines of similarity are of more importance and significance than those qualities that distinguish between people in Israel. I believe that these lines of similarity create the true essence of “Israelity”.
