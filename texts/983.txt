Sometimes I go to the super market to buy food to me and I meet some friends. But some day when I arrived to the supermarket one man stand in the front of the door and was screaming dresses very cheap cheaper than in the factory dresses. I didn't know what he mean because he shouted in a loud voice so I came to him and said why do you shout. because I want to sell dress do you want one? Know much money is they cost? I asked laughing. 10 dollars one he said. I thought that it very cheap. Can I see one? No they are in boxes but I'll see to you a picture. H shows to me dolls with a dresses. O.k. I said give me this. I paid to him and taking it with me to my girl friend Dina I brought you some present I said. What she asked me. Open and see. So she opened and saw very small dress and the name Barbie dress. We looked one to me and were beginning to laugh.
