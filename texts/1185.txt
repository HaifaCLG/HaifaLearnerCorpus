Few weeks ago when I came back to my home in my care I saw a crush car  beside the road.  Of course there was a police car there and few people bunch around the car.  I donâ€™t know if the driver and the other passenger is alive and if they are what is their condition but just to see the car or what was suppose to be car in the past, shocked me and made me feel a terrible feeling.  So I asked myself what can we do about the road accidents.


There are two main causes to the road accidents:  the human cause and the condition of the roads.  The human cause includes driving in speed which is more that the law allowed not to take enough distance from the car which front of you, and in general non careful driving.


Most of the accidents are cause by this causes but there is also accident which cause from the bad condition of the road.
