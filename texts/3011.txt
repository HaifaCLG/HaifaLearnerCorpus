While I was in junior high school I was bored and looked for what the other pupils were doing. There was a girl who set alone and listened to music. I've alwoys thought she was wierd, she never talked to anyone.
I also saw a boy who played the guiter, I've noticed he brings the guiter anywhere to he goes. My two friends set near him and did homework, as usual. They never do them at home!
There were two boys that played basketball. at the new filed, They are in the sport class, so it's aint strange. There were two girls that gosiped about a kid who stood next to them, he was shooten by our teacher because he through his shoes off the window.
