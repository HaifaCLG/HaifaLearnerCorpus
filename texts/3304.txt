The picture discribe day in school.
Some of the kids play basketball, there is a girl that sit and listening to music.
There is a boy that sat on the grass and play on the gitar. I see a boy that made something bad and one of the teachers tell him something.
About the girl that listening to music I think she have a good life and she have fun.
On the side of the picture there is a house that there was stolen.
The house with the name of the school there is a shows on the windows.
The wall beaind the school there is grafiti on the wall: "Number 1 school."
In the picture there is two girls sat, they study I think that the kids that the teacher scream on him, is shamed in self.
