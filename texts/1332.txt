As I look to the future I see myself growing as a productive person in society as well as an individual in my personal life.

I hope that in my journey to find success I will also find happiness.  Those are my two main goals in life, both in the long as well as in the short term.

Applying for university in the US cannot only open my mind to different cultures and experiences, but can also provide me with essential instruments in order to become a successful, productive adult in society.

As I look forward to the future I hope that whatever it holds for me, I will be able to find happiness in it.
