I eat every day Brakefast Lunch and Dinner.
In the Brakefast I eat cinimans (cornflaks) with milk.
In the Lunch I eat pasta or pattys or soup.
In the Dinner I eat pancakes.
The diffrents between the week and milk and rest of the mils are that in the weekend I eat FOD hamin.
The foods I most like are:
A creambonka - I like it biacuse of the heat and the sweatness.
B cinimons - I like it beacuse of the flavurs that on my tang when I eat the cinimons.
