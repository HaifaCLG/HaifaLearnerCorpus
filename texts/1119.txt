It was when I was 10 year old. I was in my friend house and we went to see the new houses that were near her house. We went in the first house that was nearly to finishing.


We saw many things on the floor, in the rooms; they were belonging to the workers.


Suddenly somebody said "Who is here?" in a very threatening voice and we were very afraid. So my friend ran out quickly and I couldn't move for a few moments. "Come on quickly – come on" my friend told me, but I couldn't move – in the end I ran away, very frightened.


We went back to her home and told that to her mother.


All that night I couldn't get asleep.


The next day we did in her home, and we didn't want to get out.


From that day, I don't get into houses that not finishing and houses that lonely.


I can remember his voice until today but didn't see him.
