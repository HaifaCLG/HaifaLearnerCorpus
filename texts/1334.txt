Technology has become a part of our life, it’s a fact and we can’t live without it.  But what we can do is to use it just for necessary things.

In my case, I use it not only for school, but also for keeping in contact with my Argentinean friends while I’m here in Israel.

In my opinion technology is great.  You can learn a lot if you use it properly, but the case of “techno-kids” is not good.  I think that you have to know how to control a computer, a TV or the telephone, because it’s very easy to get addicted to it.  So, if you are strong enough to know you have a life to lead and care about, and that you can’t be all day long standing in front of a TV, computer or talking on the phone you’ll get the best use of it, and you’ll enjoy it more.
