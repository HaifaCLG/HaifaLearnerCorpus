Diabetes, as we know it, is the disease in which the body does not properly use the hormone insulin, that helps the body gets the energy from sugar. As a result, the body does not get the energy it needs and that causes damage to the all system. Diabetes, as I know it, is a dreadful pain reflected from my late grandfatherâ€™s face. As a child, who used to visit her grandfather almost every week, I was exposed to all levels of pain this disease can bring. At first, my grandfather, who used to be a tall, handsome man, gradually became a bend, thin man. Then, he was forced to cut his left leg, and for him it was as if the ends of the world as come. As long as he had his full body, he could bear everything. But the minute his leg was cut off, he wished to die. So the death came, full of pain, not just for him, but for all of us.


The pain from diabetes is one of the worst. It is caused by damage to the nerve roots, leading to dreadful pain in all the body. Diabetes can sometimes do this because it blocks the tiny blood vessels which supply the nerves. Some people with diabetes get other nerve problems causing numbness, tingling, weakness or paralysis.

There is no unequivocal solution for this disease. However, there are some techniques for providing relief. One technique is; that people who are referred to a pain clinic get pills that can relieve the pain, temporarily. The other, and the most common one, is changing your nutrition, and by that to improve your physical condition.


Unfortunately, these solutions do not work for everyone. It did not work for my grandfather, even though he did try everything. Now days, people are aware to the

implications of not keeping a healthy life. Still, the number of people who get diabetes is getting higher and higher, both among adults and youngsters. The only thing for us to do is to maintain a healthy life by eating right and doing exercises.
