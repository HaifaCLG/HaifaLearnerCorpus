It was the week before "Pesach" and my youth movement group was planning a 5 day trip to Eilat, and I was looking forward to it. The days went by quickly and it was now the night before the trip. I packed all the clothes I'd be needing and I went to sleep early. I was so excited that I couldn't fall asleep.


The next morning I woke up, ate, and left the house. We all got together and we got on the bus. The journey on the bus was very long, something like 7 hours. All the way to Eilat, I was sitting in my chair and I hardly spoke with anyone because I was so excited. T was looking forward for this trip for a long time.


It was one o'clock in the afternoon, when we finally arrived in Eilat. The sun was shining at its full strength, I think that it was about 40oC. After we put our stuff in the hotel, we all ran to the beach and we jumped into the water. The water felt real great, because the heat was simply unbearable.
