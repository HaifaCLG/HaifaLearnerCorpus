During the day I eat 3 meals: breakfast, saper and dinner. In eat meal I eat different thing. In the morning I eat breakfast and then I eat cireals most of the time and that what I eat in the evenings too on dinner, but in the afternoon when I eat super I eat cooked food likce rice with vegetables and chicken or pasta or whatever my mother cooks. Sometimes between the meals I eat different fruits or a candy - like chocolate or ice cream.
During the week I eat alone or with my brother and sister but on the weekend I eat with all my family after we all made the meal together - my mom cooks, my father makes salads and my sister, my brother and I are setting the table.
My favorite meals are the one's on the weekend when all the family eats together.
