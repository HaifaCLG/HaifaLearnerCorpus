I think the idea of splitting the classes is not good, even bad, and is going to fall.

First of all, the children can’t concentrate in studies when it’s afternoon, because the most of the energy exists in the morning.

It’s clear that the students have nothing to do in the morning when their friends study.  It can lead them to do a love of boring things.

It’s obvious that the children will see their friends replacing them in school and they won’t have concentration.

In conclusion this is a bad suggestion that will cause the children to fail.
