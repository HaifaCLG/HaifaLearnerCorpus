My bar mitzva was in summer 2007 and I and my perents decided to celebrate the bar mizva in ULAM Yalom. My Grandmother decided to cook a cookies. the organizations were difficult because we need a DJ and fil and my Grandmother did work hard to cook the cookies. When we decided about DJ and film wasn't so difficult. In Saturday I reached to the BEIT KNESET and when I started to read my TFILA all the pupils in the BEIT KNESET SHATKU and MACHU LI CAPAIM.
In the day of the bar mitzva all of my cousins reached to my home and when the celebrate started the inviting was happy and all was HITRAGESH and I sang a song.
