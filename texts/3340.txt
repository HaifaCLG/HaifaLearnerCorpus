The event that happens in the picture is in the reses.
The kids are in the school yard, playing basketball, playing on the guitar and some just sitting and talking.
The figure that I liked the most is the girl that sitting in the side and listening to music alone.
I think she doesn't have many freinds because she is sitting all alone without talking to anyone.
She isn't a friendly girl.
We can see that the kids are in the end of the lessons because all of the students are out playing.
We can also learn from the picture that they are in school because there is a building with the word "school" written on it.
