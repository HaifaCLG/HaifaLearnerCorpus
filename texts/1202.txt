The incident which I have experienced, occurred 5 years ago, when I was 13 and I went with friends of mine to eat pizza and we met two boys that start arguing with us about who came first to the cashier.

After the arguing they went outside the place and asked us to join them outside, and like they say “settle the business” – because we were so proud of ourselves and couldn’t tell ourselves as cowards – we went outside and then they took out a knife and put it on my friend’s neck.

When we saw the knife we stopped the fight immediately and surrendered, because it was too much for us to deal with people who can use a knife to incident like this.

This incident, I have experienced, is hidden deep inside me, and whenever I hear about violence that led to murder or injuries, I always remember of the incident that have occurred 5 years ago.
