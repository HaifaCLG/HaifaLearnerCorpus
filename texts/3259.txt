Every morning, I wake up in 6:45 am.
I'm going to brush my teeth and then to dress up in about 7:15 am. I'm going to the kitchen to drink some coffee, and in some days if I have time I'm eating a small breakfast.
My mother sits with me and we drink coffee and then in 7:35 we are leaving the house to school and work. My school is in my mom's way to work so she is takin me with the car. in 7:45 the lesson starts, and this is my morning.
