Dear Ron
How are you?! I'm fine.
It's been a while since we met, but I got your "Happy Birthday" card. I loved it.
I want to tell you about other present I got...
10,000 NIS!!! (new israeli shekel), preaty cool.
It was the best birthday present ever. I got it from my family.
Well since I got the money I couldn't stop spend him. about everything, clothes, shoes, electronic items...
the money who left I would like to save, you know, so I use it only when I need it.
to sum up I hope you'll come to visit, and see what I'm talking about.
see you soon...
