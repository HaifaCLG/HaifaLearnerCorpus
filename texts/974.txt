Two years ago I want with friends to trip in the river we get in the water in the hard part the first part of the river was very difficult many rocks and many trees it was very unexpected part when you re in the water. I pulled up and its very difficult to control the tire and I bend over with all my buddies and the tire start pull up from me I swam after him in the end I had my tire back then I get it a deep part but when I was on my tire unexpected rock its very difficult to avoid unexpected rocks and trees you can move yourself from them hit me and I needed to sit quietly on my tire. It was really dangerous trip I liked it very much and this year I go to there one more time.
