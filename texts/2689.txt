My mornings are very intensive. Usually I wake up in 7:30am; I am going to the bathroom and take a shower. I dress up and make my bed. I don't eat in the morning because I don't have time for eating. When I go down to the kitchen usually my sister drinks orange juice and eats cookies, I drink coffee every morning. I make my sandwich for school and then my mother drive me and my sister to school.
