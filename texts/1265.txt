I just stepped out of my very last Bagrut test.  Will you believe me if I'll tell you I didn't think I'll actually get to this point.  My feelings keep shifting from extreme happiness and a little sadness.

On one hand I finished.  I spent the last 12 years working so hard to get to this moment, parts of it without even knowing why.  I passed and failed so many test.  So many sleepless nights of homework and studying and finally I can proudly say arrived at one of my first goals in life.  School.  But did I really make the best of it?  Coming to think of it, I guess that I believe I could have done better if I had thought of it on time.  And besides that all my friends are from school.  What will I do now without seeing them every day?  I must keep in touch.  No matter what everyone say.

Okay! Enough thinking about all bad things!  I finished! And I have a trip to Brazil to plan!  I have some time before the beginning of the real life don't I?
