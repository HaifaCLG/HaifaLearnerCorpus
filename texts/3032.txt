The ocation I wenna tell you about is my bat mitzva. When I was 12 I had a bat mitzva because I am a Jew and all the Jews celebrate their bar mitzva or bat mitzva, it depends if you are a boy or a girl. On my bat mitzva there were all my friends to celobrate with me. There was a DJ who play us all kinds of songs. All myy family was there too. By the time of my bat mitzva I was dancing with my friend and family.
