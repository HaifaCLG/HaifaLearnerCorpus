One day in December 8th 2019 my son asked me for a dream I had that come true I was working in the yacht in that time and I started to tell him.

It happened 30 years ago I was in the marina in Jaffa I saw a lot of yachts and I said to myself I am going to have a big yacht with a big and a lot of sails.  When I was in the army I had 10,000$ that earned in the years.  But a yacht is cost a lot of money you know like 70,000$ or 100,000$ one day I got a telephone call from the lotto they told me that I win in the big prize it was 500,000$ a lot of money.  I was very glad and surprised from the big prize that I win.  I started to invest the money in houses and cars and I bought a big yacht too and here I am now sailing with the yacht and my dream come true.  And my son told me I have a dream too I want a sport car I want a Ferrari.  Why do you want a Ferrari we have a Porche and it is enough I think.  Now it is my dream all right I will buy you the car tomorrow today I donâ€™t have time.
