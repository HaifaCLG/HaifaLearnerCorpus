Dear James,
I want to tell you about the money that I got in my birthday.
My uncle and my grandfather gave me 100 million dollars. I don't know what to do with all the money it is so much money.
I have many opportunities. first I can give a half of this money. Second I can keep the money and to save it in the band. third I can spend this money.
I think that I will choose the second opportiunity because in my opinion it is the best opportiunity. I think like this because if I save the money it will great for me for the future.
what is your opinion about what to do with the money.
I will be happy to read about your opinion.
see you soon...
