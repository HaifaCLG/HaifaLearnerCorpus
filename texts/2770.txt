Hi Yaniv,
In my bar mitzva I got from my grandmother a big amont of money, 3,000 nis. My parents gave me all the money for my needs. I think i should by a sony playstation or a computer because it will be very helpful to me that I will have my own computer. a sony will be good for playing and showing off, but because I wanna learn music I think I buy drums, its very cool and maybe I will even start a band..
