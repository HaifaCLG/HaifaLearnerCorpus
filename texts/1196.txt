Where have you been?  Do you know what time it is? Don’t you care that we didn’t go to sleep because of you?  You are so selfish.

I didn’t think you’d wait up for me!  I had such a good time with my friends that I didn’t notice that the time went by.

Of course we waited up.  How can we fall asleep when you are driving with other lunatics on the street.  Everyday at least five people get killed in car accidents and you’re telling us not to worry?  That’s even more selfish!

I thought you trusted me.  I thought you said that I know how to drive well.  I guess you don’t really think so.

That’s not what we said – we were referring to the other drivers on the road.  You can’t be in charge for their driving.

Ok.  I’m sorry.  Next time I will come home earlier or at least call you to say everything is alright.  Is that ok with you?

Fine with us.  Good night.

A personal experience:

The same incident happened to me when I was growing up.  My father would wait for me and scold me when I got home.

We got to the same compromise that I wrote about in the dialogue.

If I saw that I was going to stay out later than 12:00 at night – I would call home.

I think that this was a fair agreement.  I need to be responsible enough not to let my parents worry, and they don’t need to deprive me of enjoying myself with my friend.

From that night we all lived happily ever after.
