I have a friend that he have a problem at home his father is drinking and always give him bit him and his mother is pass away.

In his class is wasn’t accepted in his class.

Everyone tried to get close to him but he doesn’t want.

One day he went to a party and me.  Someone came to him and give him a drink he thought that it is a cola but it was an alcohol and he like it and ask for more.  And day after day he was drinking and became an alcoholic like his father.

He was a lot of many on the drink and there is no left many so he took from his father drinks.  His father found out and beat him so hard.

But he isn’t stop to drink.  He still drink a lot.  He drop school and start to get work.  It was hard for him to find a job and when he find he did got a lot of money to buy a drink.
