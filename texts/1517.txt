I guess the best way to begin with is starting with the time ever since I can remember myself.  The age of five was when my our lives turned upside down it was when I lost my father a thing that I have to live with every day struggling live, friends and family making me realise that what really hurts is when the closest people stab you in the back being surprised by life as discovering every day at a time a thing that has taught me on are hard to fear the future and anything that is unknown and on the other hand to take lessons in life tools that can help you survive, knowing people for who they really are discovering who really cares about you, making the right choice of many options, and seeking alternatives that makes you flexible treating yourself and others making life look easier and what I think that is the most important thing is becoming the person you want to grow up to be like.  After going through so much you become wiser more experienced making me think that the obstacles that were set for me have been made not to fail me but to make me a better person that deals maturely with problem to aim high but not too high a thing that can make you fall many years of loneliness made me enjoy a short time of company more valuable, the ability to move on in life saving me from the jaws of depression, though the technological advance we cannot be modern unless we change the way we think improving our behaviour by treating the people around us fairly and politely, making me realise that proud people have there pride a mask that helps them get along in life hiding their fears their pain and unknown of things in order to make good memories in the end I would like to say that fine literature will keep on existing and may it be an real thing are the ones who truly last in each oneâ€™s life making it an example to others because experiences are the bet lessons in life that gives us power to go on.
