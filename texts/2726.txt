My mother's birthday
Last mounth, at the 14th Aprill, we cellabrated my mother's birthday. It was very exiting because my uncle came from russia. I havent seen him since 1998.
The food was wonderful. my mother was really glad almost all the guests that told her that the food is grate. there were many salads, meat balls, cokes, fish, ect.
When the time was 12:00 PM. our uncle wanted to show us how can he stand on his hands but his beck was heart and he fold all the time. it was very funny to see 42 years old man folling.
