the most unexpected thing that ever happened to me was the birth of my fifth brother. I return from school, sat on the chair my mother loves and saw t.v.  My mother came back home and ask me if it's nice to catch place that belong to a pregnant woman. I was amazed, I don't understand what she was talking about. She just smiled and said to me, you might expect to get a little brother. I don't though very much that time and just started to scream on my mother, that I have enough brothers and I don't want to share my room with anyone. I didn't feel like I want to take care on him. To feed him, to hear the screaming to take him to a walk, and especially to change the diaper.
After 7 month my mother gave birth a little, charming boy, that I'm now think that it was the best thing she ever did beside me of course. I love my brother like he was me.. I play with him, teach him to talk, and even change him when it necessary. Now we are the biggest family in the town, but the happiest family too.
