It was Yom Kippur night my friends and I went to the town and walked there very late, then in 1.00 o clock we sat on the sidewalk and talk about nothing and laughing but we didn't notice that we were shouting, then a man came from a near building and asked us not to shout, we was apologize and talk in a low voice but again we didn't notice that we was shouting but this time I was very loud and the man that came before came again but new was rally angry of us and we started to run and he after us and we run and run very much until he stopped and we stopped too and started to talk about what happened and suddenly the man appear again and started to run after us then we started to run again but this time it was a long running until we got to the road and wasn't see him. then my friends and I went home and the next day we told it to the all class. It was a very frightening case but when we talk to the class they were laughing and I too.
