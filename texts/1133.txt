"Gee I'm so depressed", I said to my friend Uri, "I can't think about those matriculation exams, without getting those frightening thoughts".


"What is so frightening about those exams? I don't understand you, you are the best pupil in our class but you are the most coward of us all" Uri answered.


That's it you see, you have just said that I'm the best so think what will happen if I won't do well in those final exams, every one but everyone will laugh at me and I'll be the school joke for at least one year". I replied.


"Tell me, what are you so afraid about, there is not even a chance that you won't do them well, anyway I won't laugh at you" Uri said laughingly. "Very funny" I said, if I won't do them well, all those 12 years in school will be wasted, and I won't even be able to get a find job and raise my family in honor? I said sadly.


"Hi, Hi don't go so far" Uri stopped me and added "We are only 10 years old, so you got many years till then, and now, do you want to go to the snuffer? Movie".


"Of course" I replied and we went to the cinema.
