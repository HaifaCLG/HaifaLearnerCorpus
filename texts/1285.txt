I feel so good that I have finally finished this difficult test.  All day I was extremely nervous just from thinking about what is waiting for me later on.  Now that it is over I can take a deep breath a calm myself that no matter who my group is going to be I am always achieve a higher grade another time, in the future.  Today I'm going to do something that I couldn't do in the last few days because of the test â€“ go to MDA.  I often visit MDA and volunteer there to help sick people.  I enjoy so much being there and help those people that need my help so desperately.  I really can't remember the last time I felt such a satisfaction from doing something for other people.  Maybe I enjoy it so much because I like being around the rest of the volunteers and talk about how our day went and etc.  Today, I shall tell them about the test, and they probably get it off my mind.
