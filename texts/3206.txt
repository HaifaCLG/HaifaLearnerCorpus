car accident:
It was in the year 2000. I was sent by my parents to buy something from the store (bread, milk and stuf). I rode my bike because it was far from my home. than I cros the road and car hit me, a lot of people came around me to look if I was hurt. I was sent to the hospital and I was released there at the same day.
