Before some years when I was in class 8 subjects, I was in a trouble almost every day subjects I didn't do my home work, was running from lesson, when I stayed in the lesson I was talking all the time. I got a lot of punishments and letters to my personal file bag the teacher was disappointed from my because they know that I was a good pupil in class almost every day I was in the principal room and every day he was shouting at me and go having home. Then I class he became my teacher and then began all the changing. I was a good student again and he was upset because he thought I will be a week student now too and he thought to make him words but it didn't so in every little thing I made he was giving me a punish for example stay after school 3 hours more and things like that and one day I thought that it was enough to take revenge at my and I asked my mother to come and talk with him. And she went and talked with him and from then he was nice to my.
