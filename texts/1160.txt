Recently, the phenomenon of violence around teenagers is increasing inside school and outside it.  Ion my opinion, the main reason for the violence problem is the education which the child gets at home.  The parents are an educational model for their children and children copy their parentsâ€™ behaviour.  There is a higher probability that a child, who grows up in family in which there is verbal and physical violence, will adopt a similar way, and will be violent against his friends in school and outside it.  For example, last month, a teenager used a knife against someone his own age, in a disco.  It became clear that the teenager grew up in a destroyed family in which the father used to beat the family members.  We must be aware of this problem and stop this phenomenon.
