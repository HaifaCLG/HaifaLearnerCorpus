dear friend!
I won on the Loto I will get 5 millions shekels.
I don't belive I don't know, what will I do with the money? may I give it to my parents (No!) or dount it to in danger kids (may...). But I know that when I get the money I buy new computer, I realy need it... and I will fly to Eilat because on Elat I will swimm on the sea or a Gakuzi in the hotel...
I confuse at now, but what will you do if you get this money? go to trip? swimm? buy a candies? help my...
I wish I know...
buy buy!
