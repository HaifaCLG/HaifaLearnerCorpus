When I had 16 my best friendes and I went to a resterant to celebrate my birthday. three days befor my birthday I went to the restorant for keep some places for us.
In the day of my birthday I got a lot of presents and money from my perents and my friend, than when the evening came I met my friends near the restorant and we started to eat. the food was tasty and we had a lot of fun. I will remember this day for the end of my life.
