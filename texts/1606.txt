Learning a language is not about just to know to speak this language or to understand every single word you hear, it's the ability to live the culture of the people who speak this language so you can understand the meaning of their behavior and the purpose of using a word or a sentence in a specific situation and not using any other word which have the same meaning.


The language a way of leaving, it's almost born with every one of us. Since we were young, we started learning the culture of speaking our own language and we knew the rules of using the words where they should be used…that’s thing is like an inherited something, so every one is used to know his own culture of speaking and communicating with the others so they also can understand what we say, but sometimes if we talks to any other person who have a different culture – but maybe the same language – he may not understand the purpose of using this words or may even understand something else, which doesn't have any connection with the original purpose…take an example of the Arabs, there are many countries who expressions, because every country has a different culture, and every culture has it's own expressions and words and even a special trends.


So,  if a specific person from a specific Arabic country wants to adapt to any other Arabic country, he may face some difficulties even if they have the same language. And here I'm not talking about learning a new language, but a culture in which that the same language is spoken. So in order to study a foreign language you should study both a different culture and strange words, so you would have doubled problems.


In order to get over problems, everyone who wants to study a foreign language, he should live the culture of this language, to try to adapt this new language, and the best way for this is to go to the country in which that language is spoken and to associate with the people which spent that language, that way doesn't even need a teacher, it just need sometime and maybe a lot of money, but it's the most successful way even for those who don't like the language.


Other way to learn is to love what you want to learn, because if you love something you can do everything to get it and you may find your own way for studying this language, because there is just no rules for how can we learn, some people find it in watching TV – programs in the language that they love, and others in reading books, newspaper, and any other sources of reading. Others with listening to songs…doesn't matter what is the way but you also need a good teacher to guide you and to make you stand on your mistakes, in order to continue learning with the less mistakes that you can.
