Timi isn't a person or a car Timi is my friend and my dog. Timi came to our house some day when my sister was coming from school. He was street dog he was always in the school maybe he wanted to study when he came my father wanted to throw it out but I said no and when I said it the dog was coming and stand by me. I decided to adoption him and I called him Timi when I called he Timi he came immediately. He know how to cross the road when my mother call to us to eat he come to because he know that maybe he'll get something to eat. When I want to wash him he understand and run away very quick. In the winter when it cold and raid he came to my house and knock on the door and he stops only when I open the door and give him to come into the house, when he want to get out he open the doors. He is small dog but when someone come into our yard he barks and all the dogs of our neighbors come to our yard. But sometimes he's terrible he goes to other yards and destroy their garden but I like him very much.
