It happened one day when I was in the 7 class, and my sister was in the 11 class, it was in the evening our parents could us to come to the living room. Then they told us, that they are going to get a divorce. We were surprised even that we notice lately that they are fighting a lot, when we go to sleep. One day after, we didn't talk at all (my parents and me) I was so disappointed from them then. I didn't have the feeling to talk to them. Then my mother explained every thing to my, and I understood more about it, and that they couldn't go on living together because they don't marriage. Se we got used to the situation, and we learned to live with it. Now after 3 year I very used to the situation and it look very normal to me. My father got married again, but my mother didn't, and I very glad for it.
