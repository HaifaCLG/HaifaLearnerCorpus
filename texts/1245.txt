In my opinion, physical education should be a compulsory subject, although it sometimes can be annoying.  This subject provides the basics for everyone and helps the students to remain in a decent physical shape.  A subject like this also prepares the students of different states of fitness for places that require physical activity, such as the army.  Even though some don’t usually believe in this, a good physical shape, also,  maintains the students health on a higher level and would help make the stage, where students grow up and evolve, more healthy.  Overall, making PE an optional subject would claim it totally useless, because people who would actually need this subject simply wouldn’t choose it due to it’s threatening look.  To sum things up, physical education should always remain compulsory.

The house of my dreams would be located in a green and peaceful area inaccessible to other typical humans and would be pioneered by an everlasting and powerful source of energy.  The house would be maintained by an artificial intelligence yet still would have manual control, if necessary.  An advanced holographic capability would allow full room layout customized for any emotional condition or the mood.  This kind of method would eliminate the constant need for furniture and financial difficulties risen as a consequence to this. The house would be a portal leading to any place eliminating the need for expensive and slow ways of transportation.  It would be perfect, but still would miss something … what?
