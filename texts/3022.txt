Everyday in my boarding school we eat three meals a day, breakfast, lunch and dinner. In the morning we eat cheese, vegetables, eggs, bread, and from that we make sandwhiches, while we study we have breaks. when we have breaks we go to the room and eat snakes like chips and cookies. Then we have lunch. In lunch we eat meat, rice, chicken, beef and potatos. For dinner we have the same things that we eat in the morning.
The difference between eating in the lunchroom than in your house is that the food in the lunchroom doesn't compare to the food that your parents make.
I don't have a favorite meal I eat everything that looks good
