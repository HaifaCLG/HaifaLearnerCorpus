I see a mother, boy and girl.
The mother is koocing. The cildren are eating. On the teible I see: millk, orang jus, brad, bater, omlet, apple and cornflaks.
In the kitchen I see a cupbord, figirator, pans, clock, window, koocies and spoons. I thin that after the brakfast the children are going to school, when they come back, they are plaing on the computer, then eating dinner, and then going to sleep.
