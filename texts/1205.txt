Let’s continue with our original plan.

No, we should go home.  It’s dangerous and we should tell our parents about it.

You mustn’t be afraid of the Arabs, they cannot stop us.

I am not afraid from them, I understand them and I don’t want to fight with them or to enter their territory.

Hebron is Israeli territory.  It’s like Herzilya and we shouldn’t think about it different.

No, Hebron  belongs to the Arabs not to us, we exploit them, we control them.  We shouldn’t visit Hebron until their will be peace with them.  That way we were attacked and besides your parents should know about their car no?

I disagree with you about the Arabic problem – we shouldn’t give up for them but I agree that my parents have to know about their car – so let’s go home.


Israelis are controlling a large population of Arabs in Israel.  Since the beginning of 1948.  The Arabs had enough, they want their independence, their lands back.  That why they attack Israelis, only when we will have peace with them it will be quiet here.
