One of the most significant incident of violence I have heard of were taking place in an Arabic village.  A group of soldiers were driving and saw some old Arab women standing on the side of the road selling fruits.  The soldiers drive towards them with their car and destroyed the fruits.



Violence has been a serious part of  human kind through out history.  It may reflect in different aspects of our lives, but I believe that the basic cause is always the same.  The fact that people think they have any right whatsoever to hurt other people is the main cause for violence.  I once heard of a group of soldiers who destroy the fruits that Arabic women were trying to sell.  This example illustrate my main idea, which indicates that people think they have a right to hurt other.
