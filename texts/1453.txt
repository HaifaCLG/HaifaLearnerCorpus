We all know that this idea of having more time is impossible. So let's take it a bit further and pretend that we will live until age 200 .Aha, now we have time...so let's see...


I'd probably enjoy myself until the age of 50. I'd work hard to save money for traveling, and in the same time I'd do my best to win the lottery. Once I'd have the money I'd travel to places that I have never been before. I'd go to South America to see the beautiful places and the sunny beaches .Then I'd go to Africa to see the incredible forests and the wild animals.


Now, at the age of 50, it is the time to settle down. I'd like to start studying something that I'd found very interesting and useful. I'd study all the way to the PhD, and after  getting a degree I'd hope to find the love of my life, get married around my sixties and then enjoy life together with my husband. Together we'd built our house, design a lovely garden with exotic flowers and host a lot of friends.


So, here we are in the age of 100. After we had already enjoyed ourselves we'd bring a few children to this world. I'd take care of them with all the patience that I have, because now I have all the time in the world to enjoy my children and my grandchildren.

I have another 100 years, don't I?
