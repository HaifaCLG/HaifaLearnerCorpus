Dear Omer,
You won't believe it, after my 3 birthday parties (you know, my mom's family, my dad's family and the friends), when I counted the money of the presents, I found that I got 3,000 shekels. I have lots of things to do with it, I can upgrade my computer, and it's really urgent, because new games don't work well.
Or I can buy a TV console, Nintendo Wii or XBOX 360. Maybe I should buy a Nintendo DS console..
I think about buying a new guitar, or a surfboard. I've got so much to do with the money, I think I'll save it until I'll decide.
