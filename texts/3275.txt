The family event that I want to tell about is my brother bar mitzva.
3 weeks before the event my parents started to look for a resturant to celebrate my brother bar mitzva. I remmber going to fancy resturants to taste thier food and to decide if it's good inaf for the big ocassion.
when the time of the event had come all of my close family members were exited, and we were thrilled to start the event. After the event had begun all of my family members came and we had a great time. The food was great, the music was calming, and the event went amazing.
During the event an interesting thing happened, from out of nowhere one of my parents best friends began to do stand up show, and no one could stand on his feet because of the laughs that went on. In the end, the event was really great and we all had a wonderful time.
