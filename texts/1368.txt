It was a hard situation.  I didn’t know what to do.  My dilemma is a serious one.  My best friend didn’t feel good last week, so she decided to go home before the end of the day.  And we had to hand in a worksheet to the teacher.  So she gave me her paper in order to give it to the teacher the last lesson but unfortunately I lost this paper.  I went crazy.  I didn’t know what should I do.  I lost her paper.  She even told me that she worked hard on it.  What you suggest I should do?  May I go home and write an excellent paper for her and to hand it in the next day without telling her or should I apologise and tell the teacher that she didn’t come the whole day.
