A bar mitzva celebrate.
All my family (family of my dad) were been there. The food was tasty. we heared a quiet music when we eat.
In the middle of the celebration, the mayor of haifa, Yona Yahav came in.
The father of the "bar mitzva Boy" works withe him. It was a surprise. Every body looked at him.
It was a uniqe moment.
