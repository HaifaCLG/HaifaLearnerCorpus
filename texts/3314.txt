I chose to tell about my bar mitzva party. It was three and a half years ago. my parents decided to take the whole family to launch at a restaurant in haifa. We checked lot of restaurant and finaly chose "The Shmura". They have great food and good service. We hired a band that played all the time. My whole family and friends were there, even some I never met before.
One funny thing that happaned is that my cousin fell while dancing and all the family laughd at him for weeks.
But in general, the event was great and I got a lot of money from the guests.
