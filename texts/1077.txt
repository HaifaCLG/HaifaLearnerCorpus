My name is <NAME OMITTED> and I have just moved into a new school. Until now I have learned in Galili a school in Kfar Saba. I didn't liked this school from the beginning but I decided to it a chance. That school is a very tough one. You have to learn many hours and subjects and you have about 2 or 3 exams a week. The rules of the school are very tough. Maybe to me they are a bit tougher because I'm used to a totally different form of school and learning. My first six years of school I learned in my village. It was a small school and it had its own system of teaching, each pupil in his or her self progress. The next 2 yeas I leaned in a junior high school in Kfar Saba of course it was different from the elementary school but it was still nice. Then came Galili. I didn't left Galili because of my grades, there was nothing wrong with them. One reason was what I have just written above but there are more. Most of my friends went to Beit Berl but I went to Galili because of its name as a good school but still it disturbed me that I'm not with my friends. Moving into Beit Berl wasn't nice and easy. I in the months that I have learned in the other school I have made some good friends that I wasn't sure I want to leave. I also was used to the teachers and the school. Now when I am to this school I have to go throw the same process again: meeting and having new friends getting used to the new school and the new teachers and also I have to complete material in some subjects a geometry, literature and more. I was aware to all this aspects when I made up my mind to come here. From the five days which I'm here I can say that I like it so far. I hope I'll continue to like it in the future.
