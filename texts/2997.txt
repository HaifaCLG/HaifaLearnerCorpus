A few weeks a go my friend had a bar mizva and my parents, brothers and my drove to haifa and celebryted with him. Jaz music was played by a band and many people danced.
My friends brother made a video with picturs and short family movies and it was very fun to watch it. I was very hungry, so I got very happy when the food was served. I ate about three stayks and some pasta too. The food was very good and everybody enjoyed it. After all the gustes finished there food my friends family said a few thing, his mothers speech was very funny and I think my friend was very surpriesd by how funny his mothe is.
