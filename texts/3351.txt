I eat 3 meals a day: Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.
At Breakfast I eat a sandwich, At Lunch I eat meat and rise And at dinner I eat fruits or a salad.
The type of food I like is chocolate, some junk food and cola but I eat them only once in a time, maybe once a week. I usually don't eat them because they aren't healthy.
At weekends I usually don't eat breakfast cause I don't wake up early, that is the difference between the whole week and weekends.
My favorite meal is rise. I love rise because of it's taste. I think the most important meal is breakfast cause it wakes you up and gives you energy to start the day.
