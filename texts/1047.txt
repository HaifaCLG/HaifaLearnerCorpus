It was a shiny Monday, we all had 3 hours to ourselves, so we sat on the grass and talked about the bad old days. Now we are 20 years old and we are serving in the army for 2 years now and soon we will release from the army. The discussion had come to our happy school days and some of us said it was awful and some of us said it was the best time in our lives. Well I thought that generally it wasn't in such a bad time. Every day we meet one another and laugh together. Maybe the exams was a bit hard but if I am looking backwards I can't say didn't have a good time. Every year we had a trip for 4 days and some shorter trips and we had experiences and now we can raise the memories together. Anyhow, I think that the school gave to me a lot of knowledge. It wasn't so bad after all.
