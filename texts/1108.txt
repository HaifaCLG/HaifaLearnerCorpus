I don't know from where I take this change to write about this because it's hard, it's hard to think how things changes so fast, how human being change. The story start some months from now, its start unexpected and it's seems to be ending unexpected. I met him, he triad to start with me, and I wonted this to I know him from a long time and I will ways likes him, but I didn't thing he like me to, and it come as a surprise.
We start to g out and met some times, and I like this very much, but most I like him. I was thinking about him all the time all the day, and all the night. I couldn't be with out him one day. Couldn't stop thinking about him. But we never were like "trend's real friends. I fill that some thing is not OK that some thing is wrong.
And one day when I was thinking about what wrong I start to think maybe he doesnâ€™t like me at all.
I start to think that he only took advantage of me, and it's hard. I didn't talk with him about this but all day that past it's seems to be that he wonted to show me that what I think is throw. And now I think that all the relation ship is over, because yesterday was my birthday, and he didn't say a world, he didn't come he didn't phone. And today when I saw him he didn't talk with me he didn't say world. I knew its will end one day, but I didn't think it will end like this.
But the human being is changing, and some time it's unexpected. You couldn't know what will be the following day, but if the human being was know how to expect and to now what will be in the further, all this not happened and a lot of trouble wasn't be.
