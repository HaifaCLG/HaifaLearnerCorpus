When I write in English sometimes I get confused. While I''m writing in English I always think if I spell everything correct or that I have spelling mistakes. And if the person who will read this will understand everything that I want to say, the way I want him to understand it.

When you write in your native language you can find many way to describe what you want, it is easy to flowing with the writing. But in English it''s different because you have to think how to describe what you want how to use the right vocabulary, and how to improve your level all the time.

Yet, the reason I like to write in English is because I find it very challenging. In the beginning when I just started to write in English, no ones could really read that. But now I feel that I''m getting better. I know that I have to work hard on this until I become a teacher. To think about writing while I''ll be a teacher really makes me nervous. To know that I want to do this without any mistakes. From looking at my English teacher I hope to get to this level in English and to be able to speak and write at the same way my teachers does.

I hope for myself in the end of this course to be able to write something that will be perfect.I think that when I practice a lot I will succeed, and I won''t give-up I''m ready to study hard and to get myself up all the way in this level until I''ll get to the upper one.


My twenty minutes will over soon, so I just say that I hope I write interesting things, and that you like to read it. Above all this, I enjoy to write this, and I hope I don''t have a lot of spelling mistakes.
