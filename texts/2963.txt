My bat mitzva was two years ago.
Me and my twin sister did video klip. In the video klip my parents and our two other sisters were partisipants. After the watching in the video klip, was the TEKES. During the TEKES we lighted a candels with the rest of the family. when the TEKES over, the music started and all the people danced. People ate and dance. The guesser were my friend, my sisters's friends, my parents's friends, and all the family. I danced with my parents and with my friends. After the event we did a album that consist of all the pictures from the event. The bat mitzva was fun and exciting.
