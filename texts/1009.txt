I think that the most interesting thing that ever happened to me was at my trip to West Africa. At the very first time when I arrived to the jangle which calls Broos by the aborigines I drove in a little car on a old road. A full of dust and holes. After few hours of driving, the sky got full of clouds and it started to rain. All the trees moved by the wind and the rode became muddy. Suddenly, a big tree fell one meter in front of my car. I stopped, and could do nothing, I turned the car and started to go back, but there was too mud and the car turned over. I tried to get out of the car. When I just came out many termites attacked me and I started to jump, run, and do all I can to get rid of them. Then I saw a little boy, full of fight paint holding a knife and looking at me. I tried to explain him with my hands my problem, when he asked me in English Do you know what the time? I broke my watch. After I answered him, I explained him my big problem, he called a few men who was behind him, among the trees and they put up my cr, and fixed it. After a little talk, I came back to my motel and laugh of myself that I thought I fell into men's eating people.
