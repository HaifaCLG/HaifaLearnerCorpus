Most of the modern societies in our time are consist of different ethnics, religious and language groups.  No matter which country we will visit, there we always will find different populations.

Many of the native populations have to share there country with different and not native populations.

A big part of the native population does not care abut other groups that have another religions, or another ethnic groups, but there is a small group that does not like, the idea that in their country will live different groups.  These things that are claimed here, it has many advantages and many disadvantages.

The first advantage is, modern countries cheer up to new immigrations from different parts of the world, even if they have different ethnic and languages.  These countries cheer these immigrations because, some of these countries cannot get independence.  Their native population is small, and it is not enough for establish independent country.

The second advantage is, there are many citizens all over the world and most of them are Jewish, have been cheered up by Israeli government to immigrate to Israel.  No matter what is their language or if they have married with no Jewish people.  The most important here is that all the Jewish will live in the same country, will share the same land, will develop the country and their children will live and grow up in Jewish land.

The third advantage, in modern and developed countries, we can find a lot of ethnic religious and language groups and it is because, some of them live there thousand years, and some of them have been invited by native citizens, because of businesses or lack of local workers.  So many people from undeveloped countries or business.
