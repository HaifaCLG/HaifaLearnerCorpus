I got a pretty big ammount of money for my birthday. Something like ummm... 5,000 shekels. I think I'll buty a screen card, 2 gigs of RAM memory and a better PC.
I wonder you're asking yourself: "Who gave you that much?" Well, most of it is from my rich uncles. But still i'm happy to get 5k form my birthday.
