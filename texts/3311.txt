I wanted to tell you about my bar mitzva.
On the day of the event I was a bit nervious and happy.
In the evening I was so happy when I saw my family and my friends who came to see me.
Good music played that night it make everyone get up and dance.
Funny thing that happened was that the micropon stopped to work just when I was supposed to talk and we were waiting for 5 to 10 minutes until the Dj fixed it.
