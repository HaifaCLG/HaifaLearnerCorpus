The most exciting thing that ever happened to me:
This story is about my family:
Now you are in the family 4 children (3 brothers one sister). At start before 8 years we was two brothers and my mother was pregnant – because my parents was want a girl baby – but after the born we have a boy baby – are now you was 3 boy children. We called him Nadav – we give him all the things – and he was very spoilt boy.
Before a year my mother was again pregnant and my parents were wont apkors? – a girl baby after 9 months she was pregnant – she went to the hospital but she didn't born. All the night you wait but nothing happened in the afternoon – she was born.
This was very exciting – we were very happy all the neighbors came to give us their congratulations. Now she is 5 months – she nice – all the family love she.
