The occasions in that picture had been on a school day, probably at the end of the day or at the break.
By the graffiti sign there's a boy, listening to music. Just because he is sitting alone I'm guesing he doesn't have many friends.
In the basketball area there are two boys playing basketball. I guess they're practicing for a game.
On the road for entering the school there are two girls. They look young and it seem they gossip, maybe about the boy that a teacher is yelling at him and he is dipressed.
On the grass there's a boy who is playing the guitar, maybe he is writing a song for his girlfriend.
Near him there are two girls talking about something, maybe about a boy.
