On 1987 I have won a plain ticked in a lottery in a club. This club called In. I joined it in 1987 because a good friend of mine joined to this club, and he recommended about it. So, I sent a letter to them and I wrote them, that I wont to join to their club. After three weeks I got a letter from them, and in the letter their was membership card, and I was asked to fill in it all my details and after that to send it back. So I did and after two weeks I got another letter, and in it their was my membership card and all my details were writing in it. After two months I got a telephone from the club manager and he told me that their was a lottery, and I have won a plain ticket. When I heard that I couldn't believe it, and the day after I called to the club, and I told them my name and I asked them if I won in the lottery, and they told me that I do. This holiday I plain to take advantage of the ticket, and to fly to London for three weeks.
