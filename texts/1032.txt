It was a terrifying night, there was a strong storm outside and I was alone at home. The wind had knocked on the window's the rain had knocked on the windows to. While I was watching t.v. I suddenly heard a loud noise coming out for the basement it was a loud scream a frightening one. I was frightened because of the scream but I didn't came into panic, I walked toward the kitchen slowly with shivering legs, and I took from the dish washer a big sharp kitchen knife. and I started walking to the dark scary basement. I was afraid to open my eyes and to look into the dark basement but I over come my fears and I opened the basement door. The door had opened in a loud voice like the doors in a film I looked into the basement and I saw a big orange color eyes shining in the dark in a frightening way. I took the big sharp knife and I throw it away toward the shining eyes, and I cried get out of here you miserable monster. Suddenly I herd a loud voice and I saw the shining eyes coming toward I run away and I hide behind the armchair and I saw the monster coming out of the basement, it was our kitten.
