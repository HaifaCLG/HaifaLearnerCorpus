The previous month my big sister has got married. I found my dress just two weeks before the wedding, after a long search. At the wedding day we were all very nervous. We dressed at "Mikasa" where my sister was dressed two. At the wedding I cried a little and I didn't want to stand where the seremony because I was too nervous and I was afraid I'm going to ruin it.
I invited al my close friends and we were dancing all night long. because of that most of us don't even remember what food was but I heard it was great.
when we were dancing my sister's husband was quite drunk and he decided to pick me up I fell from his arms and the photographer was laughing at me.
