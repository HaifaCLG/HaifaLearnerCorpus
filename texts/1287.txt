Finally!  Finally I finished the Bagrut in English.  I can't believe that 8 years I studied English and I finished it.  I'm so happy now, this is so relief.  The Bagrut  always seem to me so far, because of that I can't believe that I already pass this.  It look like a dream that come true.  I always dream to pass this Bagrut  because it always worry me.  And now I pass it.  I will celebrate this because I want to forget that I have a Bagrut.  Although I'm happy the Bagrut didn't go so well, but it cheer me up that I know that I pass this Bagrut.  I think that today I will go to a movie.

I didn't see television for a long time because I always study to the Bagrut.
