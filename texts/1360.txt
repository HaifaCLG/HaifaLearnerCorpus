Hello, my name is <NAME OMITTED> and I live in Israel.

I read your article in the newspaper and as a teenager I feel that the most important thing to teach the teenagers today is the terror in Israel and all the politic situation in here.  Also I think that social materials are very important.  Boys and girls should know all about birth control and what is right and wrong.

I think that people in Israel need to be aware to their difficulties in living here with the Arabic people.  Itâ€™s not easy to live in Israel and the teenage need to say what they feel about it.
