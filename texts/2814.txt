Hello Nahoom, for my 13 birthday I got 1000 shekels from my grandpa. I was very exaited. then I have a problame, I didnt know what to buy? I was thinking about buying some vidio games for my computer and for my TV. (playstation 2), but on the other end I really wanted a hey high teck celloolar phone. I didn't know what to buy so I talked with my parents. They didnt exactly help, they just said that the money is mine and I can spend it on what I want. But then I thought to my self, why spendig it if I can saved it so I went to the bank with my father and "checked in" the money. When I will really need money, I will have money (but I still want a new celloolar phone!)
