I'm now in the army. I'm sitting with my friends and we are talking about school. In the beginning I didn't like school and that feeling grow stronger over the years, but now when I'm after it I know it was very helpful for example in the future when I'll go to work I'll need my report card or I wouldn't get my job.  I hated the homework the most and all the sitting in the class, but I did like some subjects like chemistry, biology and history, I think I liked them because first of all I know them good and they were fun to learn. In those subjects I got good grades and the teachers like that. When I learned I thought that were mean but now I know that they were only trying to help and teach.
