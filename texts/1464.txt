Amit Keren was 18 years old, when I first met him. His brown hair was still wet; it looked like each strand knew her place to be. Thick bright brown eyebrows lead you to beautiful brown eyes, which make you feel like you want to go inside, deeper and deeper. Small nose that connected to his thick soft lips. Like a really baby face. His wide shoulders make me feel like I can always put my head there when I needed. Slim man, not to tall, with soft big hands. His legs made him look like football player, short and wiry. When we started to talked I found that his voice very gentle, he knew how to say the right things at the right time. He is kind of a person that you always would like to be around him. He is very sociable and quantity of his friends can vouch that. I appreciate our friendship because of many things. The most important thing is that he is very credible man. I can always trust him. While you learn to know him you will find out that he has really good personality. He always helps to others, friends and family. His adventurous side may seem to be mischievous but just that you know he always thinks before he is doing something. That's the way I could sketch Amit, my boyfriend. If you didn't have a picture of a beautiful man in your mind, after you finished read this, so maybe I'' not good artist.
