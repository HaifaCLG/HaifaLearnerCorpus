I want to go to the Golan in spite of a terrorist attack because I think this is the last time I can visit here and I don’t want to miss this chance.

Don’t worry.  Golan will be ours forever but now I can’t because I feel bad and I want to get home quickly as possible.

Don’t you understand it.  Barak wants to give the Golan to Arabs.  If we won’t do it, they will do a terrorist attacks.

But it is dangerous.  Look by yourself we have just been attacked.  I have an offer for you:  now we can go home and tomorrow we can organize a group of people and demonstrate at the government office that we don’t want to give the Golan.

Yes!  This is a great idea.  I would agree except for giving Golan.  Golan is the most beautiful place, and it is in a high place – we can see all Israel from there.

You are right.  Moreover Golan is a good place for trips and knowing better the Israeli land.
