When I was 10-11 years old, I drove on my bicycle and I had on the bicycle something that made very loud noise, a noise of a motorcycle, and some day something upset me very much so I took my bicycle and drove very fast and I made a lot of noise with the noise maker and I drove to one of the yards? And a car came out and I didn't see or hear because I did a lot of noise and I couldn't see her because there wasn't able to see  and I drove very fast into the yard and the case came out unexpectedly and I drove into the car crashed unexpectedly the luck was that the car driver was driving not fast.
