Dear Eyal,
I went to the lottary a few weeks ago, and right now I got phone call from the lottary ministry saying I won a million dollars. I was very shocked and surprised.
I thought of some choises of what to do with the money: (1) I can send it for charity. (2) Buy a car. (3) Buy a big house for the future.
I think I will go for the third choise, because I always dremt about a place of my own.
But then again, I'm not sure. What would you did if you were me?
Answer me the soon you can.
I love you...
