The cleaning man school was a short and plump person. He was middle aged had a small beard and usually wore sun glasses. He was a regular person had an average salary a wife and two children. His work weren't very hard, Every day he did usually the same work. Cleaned the same corridors and mopped the same floor.
One day the school manager called him and said I am an old person I can not go on in my age taking care of a school I am going to resign and I want you to be the new staff manager. Yonaton was very happy and he did a good job as a staff manager. Although he was promoted and now earned more money his personality did not change and one could still call him a cleaning man. Two years later the administrative principal died in a car crash. And he was the one to take his place. Two years later the principal retired and of course he was the person to take his place. Although he was a school principal now, part of his heart was still a wash man.
Some time later a student reunion was arranged he came to the party when he met two of the students that once learned in that school they were talking not far away from him as he appeared them he herd one of them say, the school hasn't changed a bit, they even have the same cleaning man.
