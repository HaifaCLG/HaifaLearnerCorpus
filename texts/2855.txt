My bar mizvah
my bar mizvah, was in 19/10, on "Kala". the ULAM ERUIM. First me and my family met there my close family, like my grandmom, all of my cousins, and after that friend's started to show vp and it was really fun. after all that , we hada great lunch, and some dancing between. the bar mizvah was very fun but my favorite part, was when we stopeted to dance, and the bar man gave us cold and tasty ice cream's. I ran to the bar and took a vanilla Ice cream!
