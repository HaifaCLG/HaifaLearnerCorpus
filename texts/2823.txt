My bar mitzva
In my bar mitzva we invited lots of family and friend's. There was a lot of food, saled's, steak's, fish and many more. it was very taesty.
The DJ. put some music and we all danced.
After every one ate my family got on the stage and talk. after they finsed I got on stage and talk, then they put some photes on the big screen and everybody watched. I made a lot of fun.
One of my friend was very funny he was talking to the witer and ask him lot's of stupid thing's like why the lemon souer it was very funny.
