We need to give back the territory.


No we shouldn’t.


Why we need it.


We need it because it’s part of our country and our people live there.


I can believe that you said it.


It’s true I really think that way because it’s part of us and I can believe that you said it.


Dani I give up you right.


I think that it’s cruel to remove territories because people are regular to that place and that isn’t ok that they will take from them what belong them.
