I will never forget our last Pass over.
Most of the family was together in my grandmother's house, and even my cousin from the USA came.
we all read from the Hagadah, even the smallest kidsw who are seven years old.
Later the food was served - all made by my grand mother, very tasty, and of course kosher.
After we finished the reading we also celebrated my mother's birthday. It was so special because we had one more relative with us - who we haven't seen in a long time.
we laughed a lot and had many interesting subjects discussed.
It's only too bad that it was over and I had to go on doing my home work.
