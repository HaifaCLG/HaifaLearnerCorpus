This story comes to show that being a teenager doesn't include only freedom but also responsibilities.


On my 16th birthday, my parents decided I was old enough to have my own personal bank account, and as a birthday present they deposited 1000 Shekels in the account they opened for me. Of course I was very happy. Finally I thought, I wouldn't have to ask my parents for money every time I need something extra.


One day, about two months ago, while I was in Tel-Aviv, I passed a shop that dealt with various kinds of hobbies. I got curious and entered the shop. It was a big shop that spread upon two stories, and when I started to wander up and down, I noticed a remote-controlled airplane. I got so excited that I decided to buy it, no matter what the cost was. I tool it to the cashier, who told me that the price was 1,500 shekel in two payments. I decided to buy it after all, thinking that if I work hard this month, I will be able to pay for it in full, but as it turned out I was so busy with my new toy that I didn't have the time (or the will), to get up and work. At the end of the month, I was supposed to send the second check, but I was unable to because of the lack of money. I was embarrassed to turn to my parents, but it seemed as the last resort, since I got a warning letter that if I didn't pay, my plane will be repossessed. Naturally my parents paid the bill, but they were very angry with me and made me give them back every penny, and by the way â€“ I'm still working in a car wash, our car wash.
