The most unexpected thing that ever happened to me, happened when my father and I were in the united states in Arizona. At the o clock in the evening we went to see a movie in town and  after than we went to eat in a weird restaurant that called the safari. I ordered shark meet and my father. After the dinner we wanted to go to the hotel so we stopped a taxi and told the driver to take us to our hotel. After 25 minutes we arrived to the hotel but it wasn't our hotel. We looked up and we saw the hotel's name. It was just like ours but it wasn't ours. Then after that we checked it out we understood that we aren't in our hotel's town. And that in that town there is an hotel that called just like ours. After that we took the taxi to the right town and the valet even didn't want to take the money and said it was his fault.
