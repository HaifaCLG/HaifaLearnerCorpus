If I have just completed a difficult task â€“ for example, I have finally finished taking all my Bagrut examinations, I will be proud at myself and for a couple days I will feel that I am the most happier human in the world!

Although I finished the Bagrut examination I don't think that my life will change because my friend will be the same friend and my family will be the same family, everything will be the same, except the fact that I am not going back to school.

The day that I will finish the last Bagrut exam I will go with my best friend to the sea and just sit there on the beach, breathe the clean air from the sea look toward the horizon and enjoy the moment.  At the evening I think that all the friends from school will meet at some nice place and talk all the good memories and the bad memories school.
