Dear Lior,
Last month I had my birthday, and all my family gave me money. I was a bit upset because I wanted presents, but I realized I've got 1,000 Dollars!
Since then I have bought three payers of shoes and four T shirts. I also bought you a present. I still got a lot of money, and I don't know what to buy with it. What would you buy if you had the money?
I think I will buy something to my brother, What should I buy him?
I want to buy something big, maybe a horse. I alwayes wanted a horse.
Well, I'll let you know if I'll buy something special.
Write to me soon,
Your friend...
