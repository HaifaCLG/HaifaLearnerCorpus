My father bought a little engine on year ago in 1988. it has just 3,5 hours power. He bought it for lawn grass but it just stand in the garage for half year, and he didn't worked with the engine at all.


One day Amir came to me and asked me if I want to build a little carting (a little car with a little engine). I told him that I want and I have engine for the carting and he came to me and we started to build the carting. We started with the engine. We put him together with the back and in the shop we put all the things together. We had a lot of problem like : we had to pull the carburetor over and find an automatic clutch and it was hard but we made it and we are proud of our self â€“ we build our own car alone and it drives fast like 70 km in an hour.
