I'm going to talk about my moving from America to Israel. It was in the summer of 2006 when my parents decided to move to Israel. I was shocked by the way they told me and my siblings. This was the hardest thing I went throught because I left my friends, the country, and my life. This ruined my childhood.
I think that everything happends for a reason and for the best. I could say that I miss everyone and everyting that's in America.
