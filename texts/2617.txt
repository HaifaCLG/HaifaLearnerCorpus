Evry morning when the kids wake up I make breakfast.
Its really importent that children eat befor they go to school.
every morning I make them a egg, I put on the tabel cornflakes, butter, cociks, milk, bred.
the kids like to eat in the morning its relex them.
In the kitchen there are so much things like:
toster, table, chire, picture, clock, plants, dishes, carton
After the kids finish thire breakfast they go to school. and in sunday they eat and go see TV or play with friends in the gardan.
