As a matter of fact, all the world is a stage so weird and funny one with so many players, actors and professionals.  I guess this is true apparent picture we all see, draw and paint, so many different colours and unclear lines which leads to no dimensions but nonentity material ones, as soon as it peters like never been.

In fact, both men and women share the same stage and different parts while consequences are similar.

In my opinion, this author presents one individual spectator of those who are considered to be audience.  So many views, pictures and paintings human draw as themselves or maybe thinking they are by drawing specific pictures of them just to be seen so.  As well thinking they’re achieving aims by wearing masks on their in order to get another different forms and transformations.  I think the author means that both mean and women play parts which means people are not really are, the way they might seem to be, men as well women wear masks of personalities they want or maybe seek to.

In addition to that consequences and results are never incontestable.  Men have their own ways, in order to get what they want or seek to, so are women.

Nowadays, both men and women “almost” have the ability of playing any kind of role.
