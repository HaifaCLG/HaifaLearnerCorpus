To My Panpal
Yesterday I got 1,000,000$. I was so amaued and cumfused. I couldn't unerstood from where the money came from.
I run fastly to my mother and told her what happened. She told me that this was my uncle in LA. his name is "Bill Gates" if you know he was the inventor of the computers.
I thanks to Bill and went to "kirion" it's a many ghops together in one bilding.
I bought everthing I want. It was so fun. there I bought presents to all my family.
I thought if It I would buy a prest to Bill but I decided not to because he has everthing he want!
I decided not to spend all my money because it's a lot of money and maybe in the futhr I will need it!
So my panpal if you need something, write me.
I'l bought present to you too.
In love...
