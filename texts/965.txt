The most disappointing thing that ever happened to me was: when my best friend promised me to stay at her house before she is leaving the country and we'll go out together and on the day that we planned it, I stayed at home and didn't go to school that day and went to meet her and she wasn't there because she went somewhere else and she forgot what we planned. I was very disappointed because you expect a little bit more from you best friend.
