During the day I eat a breakfast that includes a cornflacks and little beat of bread with cheese on it. At ten 'qlock I eat two sendwiches with a whit cheese. At noon I eat meat with potatoes or ptitim or rice.
In the evening I eat a salad and some cheeses.
I like to lunch because its tasty more the other meals.
