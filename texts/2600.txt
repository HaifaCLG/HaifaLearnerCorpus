Befor two months I celbreted my Birthday, this was fun. my family gave me presents like: money and cloths, With my money I bought a new shoes, and in my class my friens, said to me "happy birtday". and in the next year I celebreted "bar mitzva". I think, I go to travel in cuntry. But not in "Israel".
