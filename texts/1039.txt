The most unusual thing that ever happened to me was that a dog urinate on me. I was waiting to my friend near a cinema, a dog came near me. i started to pat the dog we talked to one another well, I talked to home. Then I stood up and turned around. and when I did so I saw that the dog is weeing on the place I was sitting at that moment I realized that maybe he urinated me. I started to look for wet places on my coat and there it was a wet mark on the left pocket. A couple of minutes later my friend arrived. It was very embarrassing but it was funny too. I never had such an unusual accident, but it sure was funny.
