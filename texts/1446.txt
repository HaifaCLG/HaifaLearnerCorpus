In my College there is a sport department and also a gym.  All though the gym is available for participation of all the departments my loaded scheduled hardly allows me the opportunity of taking part in the sports activities. In the past I was more involved in sports activities than today. When I was younger in the age of 15 I was a player in a volleyball team and liked it very much. I have become very aware of the importance of sport since all my family members are engaging in sports activities. My brothers for instance are taking part in the fields of basketball, football and volleyball.

Usually People associate the sport section as a mean or a tool of losing weight. They put a lot of effort, dedicate time and sometimes spend a lot of money in order to register to fancy sports clubs or even to perform stomach surgeries. Some of them once they have fulfilled their desirable   goal- losing weight, they stop the sport's activity at once and this way imbalance their body completely.

In my opinion combining sport with daily activities is a very important and crucial matter. As we all know sport helps us to keep our shape, our health and our mental health as well. I believe that one should consider having sport as a serious matter and would include it in his daily routine. Our lives are full of tension and endless tasks we set ourselves. As we grow we have the tendency to fill our day with more activities and thus we sometimes give up the time to invest in our selves.

Therefore in order to maintain a happier healthier and perhaps longer life we all should make an effort in making some room for sport in our lives.
