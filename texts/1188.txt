I saw two cars driving in the opposite direction and they couldn’t get by.  So after hooting and shouting one driver went out of the car and started hitting the other driver and then also both passengers become involved and there was a big fight between those four people.


I was shocked by the behavior of the driver and I hope a thing of that kind will never happen again.


It showed me about the Israeli temper and I easily understood how come a few weeks ago a driver was stabbed to death because I’m sure that if that driver would of had a wife he would stab the other one without blinking.  Our environment should get rid of these crazy people and make sure the violence in this way should stop immediately.  We have to five more severe punishments to people who are violence to try and solve their problems.  People of their kind should not be allowed to integrate in a normal society and especially those who are violent to others not knowing them at all such as the example I gave.
