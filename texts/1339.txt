Dear young parents, I am glad to be here with you – sharing my experience and knowledge in order to help you bring up your children in the best way.  I’m sure you’re all doing your best already, but a few tips won’t do any harm.

Do not think too much!  Parents often get panic when they haven’t got answers for all questions.  Try to think less at education and start enjoying this wonderful experience.  Don’t be afraid whenever you don’t know what to do.  A confidence figure of a parent is very important.  Children, especially the little ones, already thinks their own parents are the best.  It’s enough showing confidence and stability for your child to stay calm/

In addition, communication is the key for a good relationship with your child.  Even a small talk when they get up in morning and another one when they go to sleep is enough to know your children’s world.  parents who haven’t done those small talks and tried their best to communicate with their children suddenly realised their children aren’t connected to them at all.  You will regret that for your whole life.

In conclusion, being a parent is a wonderful, positive experience.  you should take it seriously, but enjoy this as much as you can.  I hope you had learned something that will help you as parents.

Goodbye!
