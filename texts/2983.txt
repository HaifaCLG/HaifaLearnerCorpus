Dear friend,
You don't believe what a birthday I had. I celebrated all the evening and all my family was there. I got some great presents and I gro from my parents 1000 shekels to spend on the present that I want.
What you will buy if you had the money? I thought about - something like new computer, or new guitar or even new Bike. From all the options the one I think to chose is a guitar, I was thinking of replacing my old gitar for a long time and I never had a chance to I6.
