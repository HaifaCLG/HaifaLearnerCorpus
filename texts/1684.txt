Television commercials are insulting to the average viewer because they are sexists, gender biased and they mislead the viewer.


Commercials are sexists and gender biased for several reasons. First, they are chauvinistic; the commercials show women in connection to house caring. For example, publicities with women cleaning the house, doing laundry and preparing food. Second, they use slim models to present fancy cars, this may create the illusion for the male viewer that the car will bring him women; this also shows how women are use as objects, as if they were extra accessories to the car.


Commercials are misleading the viewer in numerous ways. They demonstrate that all the products and all the machines work great on television when in fact they don’t. They use special effects to attract the viewer, and embellished the reality that is not so pretty. For example, the hairs products which are supposed to change the look of your hair in a second when basically, the publicity model sat for hours at the hairdresser to make it perfect. Another example is the washing machine powder which is supposed to clean the clothes perfectly, when in reality it doesn’t. All in all, it’s insulting that the commercial’s firms are “making fun” of the viewers by misleading them.


In conclusion, people should think twice before running to the stores to by products they saw on television, because they need to remember that not everything you see is real.
