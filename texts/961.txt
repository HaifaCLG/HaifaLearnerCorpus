I am a leader in my village. I lead children in age of nine and ten. I have partner, her name is Michal. We are in the same age. Our meeting with the children are most of the times good and successful. Before some weeks, we had very frightened experience. Two girls began to fight on with the other, we used to this things, but this fight wasn't usually. We separated the tow girls, but it didn't help. One of the girls picked up a stone and want to threw it on the other girl, we didn't let her to do so. I took one of the girls and went with her to a far place, and Michal held the other girl. The girl who Michal held managed to ran away from her hands. She picked up very big stone and she really want to throw it on the other girl. It seemed that she really want to kill her. I know that she is little girl and because that I very frightened. I knew that in that moment she didn't thought what will happened if she threw the stone. I and Michal held her very hard, and put the stone on the ground, and told to the other girl to went to her home. The girl that we held was very strong and to both of us it was very hard to held her. Finally we let her down, after we was shore that the other girl arrived to her home. In the night we went to her parents and told them what happened. I hope that such things will not happen another time.
