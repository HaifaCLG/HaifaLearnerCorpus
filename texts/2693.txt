Hi Sigal,
Yesterday was my 16 birthday and I celebreate this in a big party with 70 people.
I received lots of gifts and also lots of money - 3,000 shekeles.
What I plan to do with the money is:
to buy lots of clouthes of course, shoes on GALGALIM that I want lots of time and some things to my new room, because I just move an apartment so I need pictures and such things like this.
I am also want to keep 1,500 shekeles to the fauther and don't west all the money in one month.
