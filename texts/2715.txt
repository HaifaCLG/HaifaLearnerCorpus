I celebrated my bar mitzva at 15 to september and I enjoyed. My mom took care of the most things and that a big secses as a lot of people said. I invited my best friends to the bar mitzva which was celebrate in a big hall and ther was a lot of food and a nice music even that I had a horroble taste in music.
But I had a problem ther, one of my friends fought with oters in the event and it took to me and some friends who hadn't fought with him to make him forgiv the others but in the end every one went home smiling.
