Hello Michelle,
yesterday was my birthday. I was so excited.
My mother woke me up in the morning and in the living room there were many many presents. It was all for me! Then, In the afternoon, the mayer gave me money.
It was abig sum of money, and I still don't know what I'm going to do with it. I was hoping that you will help me decide what to do with the money! I'm sending half of the money, I hear it will soon be your brother's birthday so get him something nice.
I think I'll buy with the money a new car for the family, I know they will like it. It will soon their YOM NISUIM, so it is the best present for them. If you had too 5,000,000 dolars, what will you do?
I'm waiting for an answer from you.
