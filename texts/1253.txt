I agree that the overcrowding in the classroom is a big problem today.  The overcrowding makes the study more hard than it suppose to be.  The teacher can’t answer to all the students, and I am sure that there is a lot of noise.

But I heard one solution that has been suggested that I am not agree with.  The solution:    classes will be split and taught in two shifts, half the class in the morning and the other half in the afternoon.

This is the bad solution I have ever heard!  Class is a class we can’t split it.

I want to be with all my friends when I am study.  And I don’t think that there are students that will agree to study afternoon, this is time that all the family at home and all the friends are meeting.  No one want to study when the others have fun.
