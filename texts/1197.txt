I47


A few years ago, a friend was murdered with her entire family by her father while they was sleeping.  Apparently, he was deep in debt, and couldn’t bore the shame and didn’t want his family to be ashamed either.  He woke up in the middle of the night, short his wife that was sleeping beside him, walked into the next room and killed his youngest son.  While entering his eldest son room, he was surprised to see his son out of bed and walking towards him.  He probably heard noises from the other room.  The father got into a physical tackle with his son and finally shot him too.  After that he went into his two daughter’s room and murdered them both.  Finally, he went into the kitchen, lit up five memorial candles and committed suicide.  The bodies were found the next morning when the cleaning lady came for her weekly visit.

This incident is one of the most cruel incidents I have ever heard of.  How can a father kill his four children and wife?  Can money problems bring a person to such an outrageous act?  It killing yourself and others a solution to problems, instead of going to jail?  What are the people surrounding you being punished for?

I personally condemn any act of violence, especially one so severe.  Violence in Israel is not a new trend but it is increasingly getting worse.  Every day while hearing the news, there is at least one article about a violent incident.  Some are verbal, but unfortunately, most are physical.  A three year old baby was thrown from a window.  A teenage girl was raped in her own apartment, etc. etc.  These acts must be stopped, and the government must do everything possible to prevent incidents as these.  Our police department is not strong enough and the law isn’t strict enough on these criminals.

Something must be done soon, or else our country will be in such a problem that it will be difficult to get out of it.
