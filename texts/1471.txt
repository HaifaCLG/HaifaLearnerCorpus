After a long search for a picture, in the end I found one that I want to talk about, the picture was taken when I was 5 years old. It was at my uncle’s wedding I remember that I was very excited to go to the wedding. The reason that I decided to talk about this picture, because I didn’t come out very good in the picture I was very sad and angry and there is an explanation for that. A Couple of hours before the wedding I decided that I want to wear a beautiful blue dress that my grandfather bought me, but my mother didn’t want me wear the blue dress. I remember that I was very furious at her because at that time I thought I was enough adult to decide what to wear by myself. Of course my mother didn’t feel the same way, so she clothed me an ugly black pants with a nasty pink pullover which she thought were beautiful. And even when I cried she didn’t let me wear the blue dress, so I started to tantrum, to shout and I even didn’t want to go to the wedding. I threaten not to laugh and not to dance the whole wedding, so when the cameraman photographed me I was sitting with my family on the table very sad and not enjoying the wedding this feeling is very obvious when you look at my face in the picture. then I look now at my picture I just start to laugh because I find my behavior at the wedding very childish and very rebelled I wasn’t enjoying the wedding because of my tenacity. I remember that I played the baby act I thought that my mom would let me do what ever I want in the end, but obviously I was wrong.
