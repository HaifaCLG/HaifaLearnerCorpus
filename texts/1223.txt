Lior, are you coming with me to Hebron?

No, I am not coming, I want to go home.

But what about our plan to go to Hebron?

Forget about it we will do it in some other time after the terrorist attack I just want to go home.

But if we won’t have the chance to do that in other time?  Maybe the government will bring back Hebron result of the peace agreements.

I don’t care what the government do or what happened to Hebron, I just want to go home and forget this trip.

I have no power to argument with you anymore.  Let’s go home but I want you promise to me that doing this trip sometime.

I promise but now I want go home sleep and forget this trip.
