I remembered this match this was last year then the football team Kfar Saba was good one but Maccabi Netanya was better then Kfar Saba.
This match was in Saturday I went so see it. It was a lovely match I very enjoyed from it. In the beginning Netanya was the better one on the field but Kfar Saba kick the first goal Netanya attacked more the goal. However Kfar Saba kick another gool and I was very exciting and I jumpedc to the sky of joy.
The first half ended Kfar Saba 2 goals Netanya 0. the second half began and Kfar Saba was very good in this half of match after 10 minutes Kfar Saba kicked another goal and the product was 3:0 to Kfar Saba then I knew that Kfar Saba going to win this match after 6 minutes Netanya kicked goal and the product now was 3:1 to Kfar Saba and after this Kfar Saba kicked another goal and in the end the pruduct was 4:1 to Kfar Saba won.
