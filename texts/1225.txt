Naom wants to go to Hebron..  Lior want to come back home.

The beginning,

Why do you want to go back home let’s stay here as planned we have just started the day.

No, my father’s car is broken he is going to kill me.

So what is it going to change if you are going to die now or later anxious he is going to kill you.

Yes but now he won’t be so angry and do you remember what’s happened before minutes ago we were in a terrorist attack.  We could die and it still can happen in another time and this time we can die.

So take a risk.  I don’t believe it would happen another time in our time.

Maybe you right but I am not taking a risk I am going home if you want you will come with me if not then go wherever you wants to.

Let’s go home.
