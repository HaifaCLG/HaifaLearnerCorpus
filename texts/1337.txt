Technology – such a powerful word in this ages.  We use it in every aspect of our live, almost every aspect.  Today even the most basic action – such as cooking and going from one place to another.  We use technology to perform.

Every hospital contains today computers that monitor patients lives and doctors use laser rays and mini-micro machines to perform surgery in hard to reach and sensitive places.

In highways (such as “Aylon Ways” in Israel) there are computers and cameras that “sense” the road and can tell you if the road is open, and how best can you drive in it.

There are many examples to how much we use technology, whether use for luxury or whether used for performing basic actins – is an essential part of our lives.
