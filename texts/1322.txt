Do you know why children are ashamed of their parents?

I was in Paris with my father and one day we were hungry and we wanted to eat at the Burger King and my father fell down with all our food in the restaurant, I was very embarrassed.

I felt in that moment very ashamed of myself and my father and I wanted to die.  Everybody in the restaurant looked at me.  Just like how the writer was embarrassed in the LakeView restaurant when her family slurped and all the people are looking at her and she said she felt like she was sick and she wanted to die fifteen times.

Well I don’t think it’s so embarrassing but you have to agree with me that maybe it embarrassed.
