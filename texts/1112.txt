The most frightening thing that happened to me was one evening I so to home from a date with my friend and the sky was very dark and something there bush and something. And after this was the cemetery then I saw the cemetery. I remember my teacher then died that year ago from sick cancer and my friend and I go to the funeral in cemetery.
I cry and cry because I loved this teacher very much and the children love him, then at the time that I go near the cemetery I remind what happen to my very dear teacher.
After I finish to memory they (say) I fright more and more then I start to run and run very fast because I frightened. I race to my home and I don't afraid more.
