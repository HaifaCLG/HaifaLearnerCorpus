When I was little boy I had a very beautiful dog who called Bella, I had her since I was a bay and she was very smart and addicted and she did everything I told her.  One day I came from school and I saw her walking lovely in the yard. I paid no attention to that and got in to the house. An our later I got out and want to look for her I looked around and I saw her lying under the tree. I walked to her and start patted and I saw that she don't react. I looked good at her and I saw that she is dead. So I ran home and told my father what I saw and we went and buried her.
