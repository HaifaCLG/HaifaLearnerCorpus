Since Israel was declared as a free country many immigrants, especially Jewish immigrants arrived.  They came from all over the world but the biggest and most significant part came from Europe, mostly because the holocaust, WWII and the soviet harsh government.

All the immigrants came from different and distant places with culture of their own, that causes conflicts between the “strange” immigrants and the local population and between the groups of immigrants that arrived from so many countries.

Even though the process was hated and problematic most of the immigrants found a place of honour in the culture and society of Israel and achieved positions in the government.

The biggest part of the citizens in Israel were at some time immigrants themselves so the major difference is the place from they came and when they came.  But the most important part is that we all humans.
