I was interested in Richards' article because of its topic, I found it very intriguing to read his opinion. He wrote in a high language but also clear to read. He has a wide knowledge in this area, therefore he combined between subtractive information and his own opinion. I could relate to his personal thoughts, about how frightening it is that so many people have access to these weapons that can destroy lives so easily. I can say that I learned a few things from his article which is always good.



I could relate to Hye's article because I wrote on the same topic. I found this topic very much important, although in my opinion doesn’t get enough attention. Hye wrote in an organized and clear structure that made it easy to follow. Hye raised some main points in the assay which I didn’t infer to, that made me see how wide this issue is and how much more we can learn about it. Hey also gave some kind of solution to this problem concerning the consumers. I found it as a good idea, that can be used to pour some light on this problematic issue.


This article appealed to me because I also have a cell phone and I am more than dependent on it. Lee raised the problem of viruses among cell phones which I didn’t know there is such a thing. Lee wrote very nice and in a comprehensible speech. The structure was organized and clear. She also gave her own opinion and some background information about the topic. It liked the way Lee combined between the good and bad uses of mobile phones. I learned new things about mobile phones, I enjoyed reading this article.
