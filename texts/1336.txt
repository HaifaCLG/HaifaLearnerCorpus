Technology is a dominant part of my everyday life.  When I’m at home I usually use the computer or watch TV.

The Internet is an excellent source for information.  Whenever I look for some info about something I search the Internet before anything else and I usually find what I need.  For example, if I want to buy something and I don’t know what features different products have or price ranges, I can always find these on the Internet.

The computer is also a good way to communicate with other people.  I use a computer program that’s called “ICQ”.  With it I can send an instant message that he’ll get the moment I send it.

The computer is a useful tool, and is getting even more useful with time.  I suggest using it like me.
