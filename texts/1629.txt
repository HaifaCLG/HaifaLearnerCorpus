Every body in our modern societies has his own ambitions, no matter if he belongs to a substratum group or to a plutocracy group. And as we know this word "ambition" is a good thing but also it might be a bad thing, Because when someone has a specific ambition just like becoming the most rich man in all over the world it probably will hurt others, because to make his ambition come true, he maybe do it not by the direct and clean way, but by undirected way and unlawful way, just like stealing or selling illegal thing to others, so that by this way he hurt others and perhaps choosing this bad way would kill lives of others, persons who choose this undirected way properly belongs to the substratum group, in other words, he is a poor man, who didn't think about the sequences of trying to got what he want by choosing the danger way.



But we can't look always just to the bad thing that might happens in our way to achieve what we want, some people who really think about the things very hardly before they make their first step, these are an educated persons who can do what ever they want without commenting bad things which can hurt others. These people will surely make their ambition come true and arrive to what they wanted without any problems. There are many different ambitions, that a person would think about, just like someone to take a special and high position in the society, or being president of the country, or being a famous man in all over the world, properly when a person ambit ate to something specific, it must be something difficult to get, something that need a long way to reach it, and a clean mind and thoughts to get is that's if you want to get it, without any dangerous equines, to get it without mutate to a criminal person, and to keep your honor wherever you go. That is what we call it the good ambitious who arrived by using his mind to lead him to the direct way the legal way which allowed him to go wherever he want with getting a great respect from others, in contrast to a person who choose the bad way to reach by hurting others, and without using his mind, by getting to the end without using also his hands to do direct things, by using any illegal way without thinking about the others around him, this man we call him a selfish one, criminal one and we cant consider him as a honest citizen, we thorough him outside, he can't enjoy his ambition, he arrived to the end of the way, and finally he must start it again, that's after he pay the damage that he done. These men will lose the majority of his life by paying hardly his bad things.



Thus we must before becoming ambitious we must think twice before doing any step, because this important step would change many things in our life, it would become as a good ambitious and direct and honest one's and it would become as a bad one's and expatriate persons from our places. That's why a good person must get away as well as possible from the dangers of becoming ambitious, to keep on our way and our life honestly and directly citizen to be good.
