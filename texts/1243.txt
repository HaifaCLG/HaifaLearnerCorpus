Everyone have a dreams about how is house is going to look like.  This is my dream.

I want a house that will by separate to two part.  One will be for me and my family.  My children is going to have a big room with a lot of toys and computer in every room.  My bedroom is going to be very big with a big cloakroom and Jacuzzi.

The other part will be very big with 6 rooms.  The rooms will be for homeless and a family that don’t have where to live.  I will take care of them until they will by able to take care for their own.

I’m sure that with a lot of work and if I will try hard, my dreams will come true.
