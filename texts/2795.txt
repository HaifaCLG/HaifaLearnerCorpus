Dear Sharon:
Hey Sharon.
Today is my birthday and I get 1000 shekels from my grandmother.
I thought to keep the many but now I decided to spend him on a new red bike with helmet.
My old bike see like a trash, and m father wants me to ride with him this weekend on the "Carmel" mountain, so I hope it will be very fun.
What about you?
Please write to me back
