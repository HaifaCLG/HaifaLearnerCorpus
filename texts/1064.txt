I have a dog his name is Jimmy. He is a smart dog and white beautiful dog. He stays white when he doesn't play in the mud. He is a poodle dog. He runs fast. He likes to chase after cats. He goes free sometimes but we usually take him with a chain. I train him with some actions. He has brown eyes and brown nose, when its hot he starts to pant throw the nose and when its cold he goes near the oven. Every day when I come home he jumps on me because he is glad that I come.
