Ever since there were Jews they always wanted to be in the land of Israel.  Coming to Israel became easier when the State of Israel was established in 1948.  Back then a big group of Jew immigrated to Israel from all over the world.

The biggest immigration were from Morocco, Oman, Iraq and East Europe.  The big groups were hard to handle and they were mistreated some of them were sprayed with DDT.

The latest immigration were from Ethiopia, Russian and now also from Argentina.

Today Israel has rules that are meant to help the “fresh” immigrant.

Jewish “fresh” immigrants don’t have to pay taxes, they are being helped to find a job and have discounts only for them.
