Hallo friend.
How are you, How's the family?
Too bad you couldn't come to my birthday party it was pritty cool, all our friends from class came and my uncle came by a surprise he flew in from germany and gave me 600 sheckels and i wasted allready 100 sheckels on a rock concert now I'm left with only 500 shakels and have no idea what to do with them. there's a small chance that i will fly to England for the first time. From a school project, I need 700 shekels to pay, for the trip and I don't want to ask my mom for the money, but on the other hand my favorite watch is broken and i want to fix it. I think i shood save it for the trip i think it will be smart to do that, and if it doesn't work, I wont get to go to the trip, I will still have the money for the watch, what would you do if you were in the same situation?
