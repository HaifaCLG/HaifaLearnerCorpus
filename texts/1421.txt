The entrees to the seminar have a big blue gate, and a few steps after words, come the seat of the guard. Then there is a long road, which leads to the "lobby of the seminar". The "lobby" splits to several directions.

One teak the ones who enter: to the store, a few offices and classes. The other one leads to the main offices building, to the big lawn, and to the library. That is the place were everything a student, for his daily routine, needs is there. If you continue walking on the road strata-had, on your right side you will see four white buildings, every one of them has his name â€“ wing A,B,C and wing D. the three firs buildings generally include classes, and the fourth one includes classes, but also the cafeteria and the students association too.

While you pass throw that road, you can enjoy the: Beautiful, Green, Clean and Colorful surrounding. A surrounding that has been kept, and nurtured throw the years, and on daily base as well.
