Few years ago me and my family had a cat. He had red fur and little whit. His name was Shmil. One day I came back from school and I saw him lying on the floor. I thought that he is going to die because he was poisoned by a mouse poison. When my parents came back from work. They took him to a animals doctor. He stayed with him all the night. In the morning my father rang to him. He said that out cat's condition has been improving during the night but he said that it is sick. The cat stayed in the clinic until two days later. His condition improved. He come back to our family. We had to pay old to the animal doctor, but it happened twice and another time, when the animal doctor couldn't save him. We were sad. But one day we got another cat.
