At two years ago I want to journey to visit friends and to travel there and to do another thing to go to the place that Hitler and his men's killed the Jews. When I entered to them I had a shiver until today I don't know why. When I walked in the room's and I saw all the pictures and the thing that was them I ashamed how did people can do things like this to another people how they can think about things like that. When I returned home I thought why did anyone didn't stop that now we have a beautiful country we have a army we like the other countries but it can happened here it can happened everywhere and its afraid of that.
