Today I miss school. I know that when I was younger twenty five years ago I didn't feel like this, all I wanted was to finish school with good grades, but of course they were other things bothering my mind, so I was not busy all the time with studies. The school wanted us to see the good and bad things and to choose the good ones but not everybody acted as they expected us to behave. I never really used the things I learned there, they were many hours that we spent there doing nothing, sometimes they treated us like children and sometimes wanted us to behave as grown ups and understand things as grown ups. At our school they wanted us to be perfect, they never understand they we were human, we sometimes make mistakes and forget things. We shouldn't complain and if we did we never got a proper answer, I wondered when would they understand us? when would the relationships get better. So I decided to be a teacher and see if these things could be changed, and as you see, my pupils you don't suffer from bad relationships or anger or other unpleasant things, there is a way to make things better, but you must work hard and you have to want it, really want the things to get better.
