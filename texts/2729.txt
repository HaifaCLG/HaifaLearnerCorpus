To Dan,
Hi, what's up?
With me all right, I feel very good and I very happy becouse I got 1000 shekls for my bierthday. what do you think I have to do with this money?
I think I will keep it until I will see something very intresting thta I want to buy. Or untill I will go out of country. But there is something that I will do for sure, I will buy perfum for my mother that she has wanted a lot of time. Another think that I thought about is to go with my friend to shoping, I think it can be very fun. Mabe you have for me ather interesting option, I will be happy if you will write to me about it.
Miss you a lot...
