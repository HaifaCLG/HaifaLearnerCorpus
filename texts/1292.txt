I have heard about the problem of overcrowding in the classrooms and I have also heard about the solution that was suggested.  The solution might sound as a good idea at first because it does solve the problem but I think that it's not such a good solution to split the classes in two shifts.  To my opinion the classes should remain as they are, because if the classes will be split the students wonâ€™t keep in touch, when the students from the first shift will be studying the students from the second shift will be at home and vice versa, in that way they will loose a lot of friends.  Another thing that bother me is the time of the second shift, I think that it's easier for students to study in the morning, not in the afternoon.  If the problem bothers too much I suggest to open new classrooms that will study at the ordinary hours with the other classes.
