My neighborhood is full with cats. Nobody knows where they came form. They're just walking along the streets, fighting with each other. I like them very much they are so pretty and colorful. One day I came home form school tired, I made myself a cup of coffee and went immediately to bed. There were strange noises in my window, I didn't pay any attention to them, I thought that someone works outside. When I looked at the window I started to laugh.  On the window there was a cats foot trying to reach the lock. It was a special cat he was very small. He looked very stupid but I was sure in one thing that made me feel that I'm crazy: that cat was smiling at me. I never saw a cat smiles at time before, anyway that smile catch me and I let him in. He behaved like a home cat but looked like street cat, he looked like an alien with his mysterious smile behind his moustache. I don't know even way but I started talking to him normally well it wasn't something important but I asked him which flavor of cat food he usually prefers beef or chicken, in the middle of the question I suddenly understood how foolish I am talking to a cat. The smiling cat didn't answer me he was checking something I understood that he's just another ordinary cat and that it was all in my head but just when I planned to go to the kitchen he smiled at me for me and actually said: well it was very hard decision for my but I think I would prefer the chicken although I usually takes my food cooked ill eat this cat food because I'm very hungry. I was shocked, I understood that my cat is not just smiling and talking but a also a great snob .
