I have just heard that because of the problem of overcrowding in the classrooms the class may be split and the teachers will teach in two shifts.  I think that this is a great idea.  Today there are 40 students in one class and sometimes more.  It's very hard to learn in this situation.  There are more chatting (because of the big number of students) and the lesson looks like a big mess.  In addition, the teacher cannot take care of every student  because there are too many in one class.  On the other hand there are big disadvantages to this idea,  One half of the class wonâ€™t meet the other half for a long time and sometimes one half of the class would have to stay at school late.  I don't ignore the big disadvantages but it will be much better if the classes split.
