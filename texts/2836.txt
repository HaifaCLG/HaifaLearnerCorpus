I thought to buy a new biker but not just regular biker, a biker that cost 5000 shekels. But i thouth for another opsion: to go to America because I always wanted to be there and I tink its a really advencher. With my money from my perents and the money from my family i dicided to go to America at the summer. What do you think?
