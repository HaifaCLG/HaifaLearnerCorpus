School have a lot of minuses. First, all of this system that makes us feel tense and not relaxed is really bad. Second, most of the teachers don't know how to teach. A good teacher has to make the pupils love the subject. If they don't, they just get boring, and most of them don't try to study because it doesn't talk to them. They don't have willpower, they don't want to study, they don't succeed and think they are failures. See, what is going on. Its terrible. If the teachers weren't doing so much quizzes and getting a lot of homework.
