Is it emptiness, happiness?  No, it is just a pure relief.  After a week of not sleeping at nights, not eating on days – finally the last Bagrut is behind me.  It still a little hard to believe I won’t hear sentence like it would be in your Bagrut ever again.  My head is a little dizzy and I find it hard to walk on a line but I’m ok.  I know that now my real life is about to start.  Now I am the only one who is responsible to my actions, and it make me happy.  I can see myself going back home, change and going out with my best friends to a caf? shop, just for we could see how happy we are today.  But the best part of my day will come later when I get home, put my head on the pillow and finally get asleep.

We all know how important a day to day regularity could be.  A man who own a workshop and want it to succeed should create a certain regularity, for each employee would know that he must do and when he must do it.  When employer does not know where to find his employees in a specific time – his workshop is about to fail.  When we talk about schools we talk about the responsibility of, the state to take care for the education of any child in the country.  That kind of responsibility can be fulfilled when we all know that each child must be place in school during school time.  Only a day-to-day regularity which means specific school time for the students will make the system work.
