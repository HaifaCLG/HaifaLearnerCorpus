If I had more time to do more things and so their time would be more fruitful. I think that I am doing a pretty good job in filling my day.

Well as a matter of a fact time and money sometimes go together

I can give you a personal example. Ever Since I began to study in the college my regular schedule has changed completely.


My college is very far from my house and thus I spend a lot of money and time in traveling. It is a real project for me to keep myself together since I am supporting my self alone. I really don't need more time. I'm sure that if I had more time now, I would drive myself crazy by trying to work harder and to dedicate the time to study harder since these are my main goals recently.


However during the coming vacation I would really like to spend some time to relax, breathe some air, perhaps travel, but for sure I'd go to spend some time by the shore.

My dream is to visit USA I hope that between the studies and all the work I'd raise enough money and would be able to do so.

For concluding free time is freedom I wish I have not had the responsibilities I'm carrying and had more time for myself in order to enjoy.
