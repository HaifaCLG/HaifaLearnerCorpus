In the morning I woke up as usual and I ate breakfast and I prepared to go to school.

At the radio said that in Aza was killed one man by the soldiers but this didn’t interest me.

Every day I heard about man that killed in Aza or Shchem.

In our settlement we hated the Arabs because they always threw bottles and stones or our cars but we was lucky that we didn’t got hurt from the bottles and the stones.

My settlement’s name is Okets and it is lovely settlement in the mountains.

So I went to the bus station and waited for the bus when it came I sent on the bus and in it there was Rami Michael and other children.  I sit in one chair in the bus and we started to move.

We passed near Kalkilia and I think about the flowers in the fields and then BOOM!  I saw something fly and land on one empty chair near me it started to burn and all of our went out of the bus.

No one was hurt and I thought that I’m lucky that I didn’t hurt.
