I remember a family event which happened about 6 years ago. it was my aunt's and uncle's wedding. At that time I was small but I've remembered almost every detail. To the event came all my family members and everyone had a great time,
We enjoyed the music which was played by a group of musicians and the food was great.
The wedding was held in Jerusalem in a special place for weddings, this place was anormous and aspecialy beautyful.
I don't remember that something special or unusual has happend during this event, but I remember that I enjoyed every second.
