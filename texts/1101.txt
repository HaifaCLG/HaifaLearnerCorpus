My dog is a very stupid one. I think so she always stay in the back yard and when I let her be free she always take my shoes and hide them. One day she steal my shoes and hid one of them, one I find in the back yard I started to look for the shoe and I didn't find this shoe. Before a weak my father found this shoe under the house and now a have again pair of shoes. Always when my little uncles came to my house and I let to the dog to go free she always ran after the and play with them but they afraid from her and she didnâ€™t now that they afraid from her and they climb on trees and enter my house.
