It was three weeks ago.  I want to a little walk in the evening and suddenly I saw a young man came in front of me.  I was really scared.  It was dark, I was alone and the street was very quiet.

“What is the time now?”  I heard a strange voice talking to me.  “Nine o’clock” I told him, and try to go but he was talking to me again.  After five minutes we were in a exciting conversation.  The night after I went again to this place to meet him again and then he told me that he is Arab.  I was shocked, but it was late to leave him.  I felt in love with him I didn’t tell to my parents nothing about our meetings.  In the four meeting we desperate with a kiss and I didn’t feel sorry about this even today after my parents discovered this.

It was two days ago when I told my mother that I’m going to a friend.  I want to our regular place.  After half an hour, my father passed in the place and saw us together.  He was very angry about this and told the Arab boy that he don’t want to see him again and took me home.

Now he don’t let me to go out from home, only to school.  I didn’t see him again from that night.  My father was angry because he was Arab and my father was afraid because of that.
