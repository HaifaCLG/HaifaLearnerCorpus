I eat two meals a day - lunch and dinner.
During lunch, I eat a big meal which is mostly schnitzel or sausages with some rice. At dinner - I eat a bun with something inside or a toast.
Sometimes (mostly at noon) I make myself yogourt with granola.
On the weekends we usualy eat couscous or FODhamin (which I don't enjoy eating)
I most enjoy weekend's meal, as it is much tastier than the usual meals of the week
