To understand each other in our world, we must use a ways which help us to deal with each other, to talk with each other, and to be in a communication with each other, I mean, something corporate for the humanity.

There are many different forms of social communication in the world, writing and speaking are two important forms of social communication.

But, there are principal differences between our written and spoken languages:

First of all, speaking, we can say that nearly all the people in the world can talk and speak, but, writing, there are less people can write, I mean that they are more people who can speak than people who can write.

When we speak, we can speak with movements, high or low voice, and so on…. things which help us to express about our self better than writing.

Speaking is easier and faster than writing, how?!

If someone, for example, has something to say, he can speak and say it directly, easier and faster than to set and to write it and maybe sometimes speaking can cause problems, for example: someone is speaking and talking with someone else, or with people, and suddenly while he is talking he shouting at someone, and begin an argument, then they each other and they make a problem?!!!!

Both of the two forms of social communication:

“Speaking” and “writing” have many advantages,

First “SPEAKING”:

Movements can accompany speaking, thing which can help us to express about our self/feeling or opinion better.

Voice, we can control it in the way we want, I mean to make it high or low or whatever we want, it depends to our speaking.

Second “WRITING”:

Memories – if someone write something, he can remind it whenever he want.

Secret – maybe there is someone who want to express about his feeling, and he don’t want anyone to know about him, so he write down.
