Too people I know was going to go to a trip in Europe and when they were on the way to the airport near the town they were living at something was stopping their trip. It was a bomb brutal. The massage was given to me by the father of the man that was in the bomb, he heard it in the radio and called us to find out if its really his son and his wife that burned from the bomb, first we were shocked by the massage because we thought that they were already on the plane. We dressed right way and when we went out of the house there was a lot of soldiers and neighbors who came to told us about it. We didn't know what happened to them, I thought it was an accident but when we get near the place we understand what happened and started to be frightened for their life because the other time it happened, the result wasn't so good. In the end we get to the hospital we saw that they just hurt and it have to say it was very frightening experience.
