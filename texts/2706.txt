Every morning I wake up at 6:50. I dress up and make sure that my little sister - who is seven years old - is up and getting ready for school.
Meanwhile my father prepares sandwiches for my sister and me, and puts everything we need for breakfast on the table: bowls and spoons, cerials, and milk.
Then my whole family gets together and we talk while eating our breakfast.
we brush our teeth and I take my sister to her school at about 7:45 and have a twenty minute walk to my middle school.
sometime I have time to check my email or read the news before I leave for school, but really it a nice and regular morning with nothing too special.
