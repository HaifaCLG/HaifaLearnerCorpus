While I was a little boy me and my family had lived in a big house in the village. The house was so big that I haven't even been in all the house's rooms. One day while walking in the house I saw a strange door that I had never seen. I walked though the door and found myself in a dark room. I started walking when I heard a strange voice coming from two meters in front of me. I don't know why but I wasn't frightened at all, maybe I smelled something familiar people says I have a very good smelling sense. I walked one meter more and there I was a big man standing in front of me, I stood still and didn't even breath because I was afraid he would notice me. I didn't move for some minutes so I could see the man, first I didn't recognize the man but after those minutes I could notice that the man who was standing in front of me was my father. I called daddy and he said just a moment, I almost finished fixing up the light in your room honey.
