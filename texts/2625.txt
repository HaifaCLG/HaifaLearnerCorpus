Dear liel!
Hi. How are you? I'm fine.
I wantes to tell you something and ask you what do you think that I need to do.
I had my birthday on Sunday, remember?
So… My grandma gave me 200 shakels and my uncles game me 150. Before that birthday I had 350 shakels, so now I have 700 shakels and I want to buy something big the thing that I want to buy are:
* Albums of 3 bands that I like that one of them costs 80 shakels.
* mp4 that costs 400 500 shakels.
* A computer, half – with my parents, that will cost all of my money.
What do you think? What do I need to buy?
because…look, if I'll buy the 2 first things it will cost about the 740 shakels and I will save the other money.
I'll be happy to hear what you think
Thanks write to me!
