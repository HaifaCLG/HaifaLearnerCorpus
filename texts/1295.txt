I have finally finished taking all my Bagrut examinations.  I am so happy!!  It is a huge relief to finish these annoying exams.  I had to study very hard for these exams, and for a very long time.

But now I finally relaxed.  I want to celebrate with my friend tomorrow.  We plan to go to a great beach and swim.  After it, we will go to my house and watch a movie and eat a lot of delicious food.  I'm sure that we will very enjoy and have a lot of fun.

Actually, I am a little bit sad too. N Now, after I have finished my examinations, I won't go to school anymore.  My life will change – exactly like my friends' lives.  Every girl will go to national service and after it to the university, and it won’t be the same.  We won't be good friend like we are now.  It case me to be sad and even to want to come back to school for a short time.
