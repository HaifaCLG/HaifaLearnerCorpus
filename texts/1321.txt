What are we doing?

My family and I went to a restaurant in London.  When we got in we sat down without waiting for the waiter to show us to our table, all the waiters looked at us, I was embarrassed.  Then we wanted to order and we did what most people do in restaurants – we raised our hands, and everybody looked at us, and again I was embarrassed, so we left the restaurant.  I said to my parent let’s go and eat a burger.

My story and the writer of The All American Slurp story are that alike but the main idea is the same – people from different cultures have different behaviour patterns.

By hands or with a knife and a fork.

This was the humiliation of my life!

Lat summer when my family and I flew to America we were invited to our old friends in Mexico.  When we got there after hours of searching for the place we started to eat.

Everybody sat on the floor near the small but long table, because that was a tradition.  Of course we were hungry so we didn’t wait a second before starting to eat.  We thought that it was also a tradition to eat with the hands but I guess we were wrong!!!

So they told us that they eat with a knife and a fork.

I felt so embarrassed because all of this.

When we had went back to the hotel all we wanted was 2 things:  never to eat Mexican food!!  To sleep!!

I am sure that she was very embarrassed, because what had happened in the restaurant and I feel the same.

I thought it was ok and that it was a tradition.  The same way she thought or didn’t know that it wasn’t nice to drink the soup by slurping.

So everyone makes mistakes!!!!!

Even though it was SO embarrassing.
