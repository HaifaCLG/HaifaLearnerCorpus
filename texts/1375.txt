In the last months the territories are dangerous.  When I went to go in a bus I pray that the bus wonâ€™t be attacked by Arab youth.  It is very often.  I fear from them because if someone will throw a fire bottle on us it can bit me.  If  somebody see a bag he is more careful and he calls the police.  In the last months it is very dangerous to walk in a city with many Arabs, because somebody can stab him or shoot him.  I think that many Arabs in the street hate the Jews, but we have to live with it, because if we punished all the Arabs more Arabs would hate us.

Before two days an Arab woman tried to stab a man from our settlements he managed to take the knife from her and he caught her and called soldiers.  They took her.  I scared that an Arab man will attack me.  I started to learn karate.
