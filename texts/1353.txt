Dear Mr Levy!  My name is Hagar and I am a student in the educational system.  I am writing to you because I want to tell you what I feel should be Israel’s highest priority for educational.

I think that Israel’s highest priority for education should be small classes.  Meaning, that in every class there will be no more than 25 students.  In that case, every student will be able to get attention from the teachers.  That, of course, will cause more teachers, but it will be worth it.

I will thank you if you will be able to publish my letter.  I think it is important.

Thanks in advance.
