It was very darkly night when I was going back home from my friend. The moshav was very silence and nobody was out. It was very unpleasant to be like this alone, in 11:45 at night - and I thought I have to go through more grove and after that two streets. The wind was blowing hard and the trees made big shadows every were. I felt all the time that someone was following me and looking at me and I tried all the time to think about more funny things until I arrives home. Suddenly I saw a shadow in the distance it was a shadow of a slim girl walking between the big trees. Who is it? I thought, I know every one in the village and I don't recognize that shadow. What is she doing their in so lately hour. The clock showed 12:1. I almost arrived to the end of the grove than I saw a big shadow of a big man approaching that slim girl. I didn't know what to do is he going to do something bad to her? or is has know him? No, I think he catch her and I thin I saw she fought against him. She shouted help, help. shall I call the police? yes I must do this I tried to run but my legs stuck to the ground and I couldn't move it. between the sounds of blowing wind I suddenly heard the sound of the police siren. I relaxed. Someone did it before me.
