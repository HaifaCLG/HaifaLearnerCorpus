When I walked into the room there it was a beautiful square table cover with a blue cloth with fringes hanging from it.

Above it at the back of the table a silver vase with a yellow flowers in it, just in front of it there is a round candle holder with small orange stones on it and a white candle inside.

Next to it there is a small white milk jug sitting beside a cup and a saucer just near a small plate.

On top of this small plate there is a red napkin and some cutlery.  Between of all that some green and orange tangerines laying on the table, in the front.
