I decided to describe something that really important to me. In my room, next to me bed, I have two statuettes of ducks. They both made from china. They paint in gold color. The big one symbols the man and the small one symbols the woman. I think that there is a reason why the "man" is the big duck and the "woman" is the smaller one. Don't you think? When you look at them you'll see that they made with all the small details. Their mouth a little bit open, so if you put them next to each other it's like they kissing. Their eyes made from red precious stones. For me this color symbol love. They way the person who did them made their wings look very real. There are people who believe that both of this duck symbol a relationship between man and a woman. Why people believe in all this superstition? I know for myself that when I bought this piece I didn't know what they are symbol. I choose them because they were beautiful. My friend saw this and told me all that, and I started to pay more attention to them. If in any reason they sit not next to another, I immediately change their standing. It's not just the beauty that you see, when you look at them. If you look really close to their eyes, you'll see that they looking at you. It might sounds funny, but when I look at them I see an old couple sitting and protect one each other. It's seems to me like they really still in love, after all this years together. It's like only the death will separate between them. Maybe when you'll look at them you'll say "nice statuettes". Look deeper in their eyes and you'll get the feeling that they are not just statuettes. After all they symbol a big superstition for the China's people.
