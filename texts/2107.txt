Dear friend,
I want to tell you somthing that you never forget. I get a money from the LOTO, I win in HAGRALA. I was so happy I win in 1,000,000 shekels. I am rich! you believe? I am rich! I want to give CHELEK from the money to poor people. this people can buy: clothes, games food... and more things with this money. I think that it's generous from me to give this money to poor people becuse it is sad that have people that they didnt have much money. and it's great that I can give them this money , you believe I! so I see you leater good by!
love, you know who...
