In a few month I’m about to finish high school.  That means that I will be completely through with the Bagrut examinations.  What can say?  The feeling will be so great, knowing that all these exams are behind me.  There will be no pressure such as remembering the whole stuff for the tests.  I will finally go to sleep at normal hours, instead of learning twenty-four seven.  Although it will be an amazing feeling I think I will have to improve some grades such as Tanach and history.  After I’ll finish the 12th grade.  From t he day I’ll finish the exams I can continue to practise on my piano, the last time I did it was at the beginning of the 11th grade.  Also, I can go to movies or even walking my dog any time that I want.  All of my friends say that they will have a big party as soon as they finish the last exam.  I’m, in the other hand, don’t think that there is a serious reason to celebrate, but I guess I will go to the beach with my best friends in the end of the last exam.
