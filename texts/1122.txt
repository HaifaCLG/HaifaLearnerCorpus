The most frightening thing that ever happened to me, happened in 1837 in a small town called Pheonix in Arizona.


One day, Joe, who was a famous robber come to me and told me that he was going to rob the local bank, and he asked me to come with him. I thought to myself for a few minutes and I told him that I refused. He told me that if I'll change my mind, I let him know about it. And so I did, I changed my mind because I was lonely and I didn't have anything better to do.


At 4 a.m. the next night Joe, who was a great door opener, opened the bank's door, and we went in. The safe was right in front of us and its door was open. We went in it and we saw a great deal of money. We were amazed for a few minutes, and after that we started to fill the bags with money. When we finished, we were ready to go out, but as we arrived to the door we saw the Sheriff coming in. We started to run the other way but the Sheriff shot at us. A bullet hit me in my heart and I died at that moment. Joe was captured and was taken to jail.
