Split and taught classes in two shifts, half the class in the morning and the other half in the afternoon because of overcrowding has a lot of disadvantages.  First, splitting the classes in two shifts is very complicated and not realistic because teachers will have to stay at school until the evening because of splitting the classes in two shifts means a harder work to the teacher which work hard.  Secondly, the morning hours are the best hours for studying. For most  of the students is bigger in the morning hours more than in the afternoon.  Third, it will be more difficult to organize time if student from different classes want to spend time together.  In my opinion schools have to find better solution for this problem, for example establish a bigger classroom.
