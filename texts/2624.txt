At my bat mitzva, two years ago, my brother and parents went with me on a trip to Germany and Austria. It was really fun and we spend there 8 days. Every day we went to a nother town, and found a place for sleeping just in the evening.
One evening we couldn't find a place to sleep., and we had to search for some place till 4 in the night. At the end we found a hotel and went to sleep.
