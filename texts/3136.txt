Dear Ailana
Last week I had a birthday prty and all my family came and gave me many presnt.
My grandfather gave me 2,000 shekel to buy to myself what ever I went. day after I want whit my mother to the shoes shop and I buy with this a butiful shoe who cost 500 shekels. Aftar that I go to the mall to buy earyphone to new ipod that new pernts bough to me. The eurypohone is big, good and look very good. they cost 400 shekels.
New, after I bought the choe and the earyphone I left with 1100 shekels. Thet is a lot of many!
Next week my frind and I will visit our frinds who live very far. We need to tae a trin, that cost many... and when you will get ther we want to take anther trina and go whit thir to tel aviv. In tel aviv we will go to the one park and whit the many the will left to me I can go shopping.
