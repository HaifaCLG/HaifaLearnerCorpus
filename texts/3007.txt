Dear Ran,
How are you? you can't belive what happened to me. Yesterday, I got 1,000,000,000 Euro from my fathers uncle that was a billionre, and died. he gave me the money because he liked me - more then my father. The first think that I'm going to do is to buy "Microsoft" After that, I'll buy a soccer team, maybe Barcelona. There are some more things that I'm thinking to do with my money, like, giving to sick kids, buy a new car (even that I can't drive), buy a new home and maybe I'll fly for another country. The most importent thing that I'll do soon Its to give money to sick kids, after that I'll think what should I do, I don't know excetly, write me what should I do.
Bye...
PS.
maybe I'll buy Mecdonalts.
