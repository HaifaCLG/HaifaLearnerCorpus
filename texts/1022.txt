While I was in a kinder garden I like to play a lot. One day I realized that at the end of the year we will leave the kinder garden and well go to school. From that moment I wanted the year to past fast, when we all went to a fist meeting with school I think it was the happiest moment in my life. I was so happy that I can't remember it very well. After 2-3 months we went to grade one with our parents and I was happy again. The first year was the fantastic year in my life and in the summer I wanted very much to go back to school. My happiness continued in grade 2 but than a year after a year I started to hate school and to prove it you can ask me today.
