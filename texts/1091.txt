Many time ago my grandmother gave me a dog to my birthday. One day the dog was disappear and I was very sad. For compensation my father gave to me a German Shepard. A big dog, and in the first time I was him. I afraid but after days I love him very much. And he was very cute. He came to us when he was 2 years old. And we play with him all the time. He jump and run and he was a great one dog in the night my sister want to she tired and the time was  9 in the night and I want to look what happened to her and I was walk on the street and the dog came back and jump on me and I scream because I afraid and he go back to the home and he didn't eat two days and he didn't jump and run all the time he was very sad a the days after I gave him eat and pat him and he back to his normal his name was Sandi that name is for a dog but we love that name my father love the dog very much and one day he want to USA. And the dog was in the garden and suddenly he heard a stranger noise. He come from the track and  Sandi run after the track and the track want on him and in the moment he didn't die. We didn't no what happened to him. He just walk and the man in the track came to us and said I thing we said gave home to the vet and that a last time I sea him. The vet want to help him but he can't. We asked what happed to him and he said to us he be all right. I now it isn't all right. And when my father call we sea to him and he was very sad.
