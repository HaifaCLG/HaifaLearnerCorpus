Dear Mr Ben Haim, my name is Ran.  I am a student.

I recently read the educating priorities article and I think the writer missed some major points.

I think the top priority should be to educate the students for a better future.

A future of technology and computers.  I think we should dismiss classes like literature and Bible because are not scientific and they donâ€™t contribute to us students.

This way the educational system could save money and use this money for scientific projects in school.
