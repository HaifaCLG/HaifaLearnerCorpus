It all started two weeks ago when my neighbor from the third floor decided he wants to build another room on the roof.  My family and two more neighbors didn’t approve of this building and from that moment on, the troubles begun.  At first there were like throwing mud outside of the door of the neighbors who had refuse to stop the building.  It got worse last week when I got up in the morning.  Taking my dog down and saw that my father’s car was vandalized of course we went to the police, knowing it won’t do any good, but we felt we have to do something.

This incident had a great influence on me and my parents.  We found ourselves afraid in our own home, with no one to turn to.  This obviously caused tension between me and my parents, especially because my first reaction was to hurt him back, to make him feel what we are feeling.  I’m not a shame to say that I neglected this idea only because I wanted to protect my parents.

In this absurd situation that we found ourselves in, the currently happening in Israel had a profound effect.  The neighbor from upstairs, who has a family, a job, and who seems normal through the years, suddenly becomes a potential murderer who controls our lives.  The day to day pictures, giving us by the media, strengthened the notion that our neighbor, like every other person we see in TV can lose his mind and do something even more serious.

Unfortunately, I have to say that I think the only way to solve this problem will be to compromise against our word.
