My Batmitzva,
I celebrated my Batmitzva in 2 ways - one with my family on a restaurnt, and one with all my friends.
With my friends I did a big party - with DJ, and food - It was a lot of fun.
When I got back from the restaurant with all of my family my mother told me that we are going to fly to Hangary together - I was very happy.
