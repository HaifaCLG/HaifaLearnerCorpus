Mor-el and myself are in Varanasi India. We are staying at the Ganpati guesthouse which is on the Ganges bank. The time is around eleven AM, and we are having “fruit muesli curd” breakfast. At the table next to us sits a young hippy guy. He’s dressed slovenly, and he has long dreadlocks. He’s smoking a joint and smiling. We smile at him and ask him if he would like to join us. He’s really happy that we invited him, and he joins us. He is incredible, he’s only 22 years old, and by now he traveled so much. He has been to the states, Europe, Africa, and Asia. He’s French. We enjoy the conversation with him. We love his stories about Africa; since, we haven’t been there we are excited to hear about it. His voice is so soft and with French accent (I love French accent). We finish our breakfast (and his joint), and going for a walk in the old city of Varanasi. He joins us and to our surprise he’s joining us barefoot. Now you must understand, India is not a clean place, and Varanasi is the filthiest place in India! We ask him about it and he tells us that he’s also drinking tap water here!!!! Now, I don’t want to make this story too long but you must understand; that, everything in Varanasi is related to the Ganges. The Indians empty their bowels in the Ganges, and wash themselves in the Ganges, and throw the ash of the burnt bodies to the Ganges, and throw dead cows to the Ganges, and their tap water is from the Ganges. Ok, we realized he’s special from the first minute. The day after he rented a houseboat on the river, and invited us for a visit. The visit was a lot of fun. Masi played the guitar (he’s a great guitar player), and some Indians joined us. The next day we all spent time in a music shop/school and jammed with many instruments. Few days later we left for Amritsar. Masi stayed in his houseboat for over a month. We kept in touch via email, and a week ago we learnt that Masi his back in India, lucky bastard.
