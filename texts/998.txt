When I was a boy 8 years old I was afraid from dogs especially from big dogs that bark. I was dreaming all the times about big dogs that eat me and bite me. One day as I was walking to my friend from one of the houses a dog come out from the house and start running after me. I was very frightened and I started to run to and the dog after me I got in one of the houses and climbed on one of the trees and I called to the people in the house that well come out from the house and one shouted about the dog that he will go to his house and the dog did that the old lady told him and this moment I thought that she saved my life because I was very frightened from dog and I didn't want that the dog will bite me.
