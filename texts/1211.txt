This is about fight between a father and his son.  The background for the fight is over getting out for family events.

Hi son, how are you?

I’m ok.

Listen, we’ve got an event to go to.

A family event?

Yes, and you’re coming even if you like it or not.

But dad, I don’t want come!  I hate getting stuck all alone in the crowd without no one to talk to and with nothing to do!

You won’t get stuck and anyway as long as you’re a part of this family you’ll come.

I hate that.  It is always the same!  You never listen and you don’t even care what I think!

Don’t argue with me.  That is unnecessary for you to do that.

And when exactly are wee supposed to get back?

At 23:00 o’clock lock.

So at least can I get money for coming?

How much?

20?

No way.  You’re coming and that’s it.  No money, no nothing.

So just tell me, what would keep me occupied.

I don’t care, you’ll have to find something to do on your own.

Can’t I just stay home?  After all I’m old enough!

Everybody’s coming so you’re coming too.  That is not for discussion.
