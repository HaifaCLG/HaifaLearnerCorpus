My event is: bar mitzva - a jush condetion. If you are 13 years old and you are a jush, you should do the bar mitzva.
In my bar mitzva i my parents trew a party with all heart can desire, but before the party I charched on the bat Kneset and I read on the Tora (jush book). After the charched I "became" a man (this is what the Tora says).
On the bat Kneset, when I read in the Tora, my Mother trew a candies and hit me on my head, I laughted but it was very hort.
