Hello dear astronauts.  I’m happy that I have this opportunity to help you get ready for your mission to go to the moon.  As you know the outer space is a little different from our lovely planet Earth – so here are a few tips.

In outer space the gravity is lower than on Earth, and the view is slightly different.  To get used to the new gravity you spend 5 hours a day inside a pool so you’ll know how it feels to have no gravity.  Put on the floor of your house many trampolines because walking on them its like walking on the moon.

Because that to get to the moon takes a lot of time, you should take with you books, television, VCR and games – so you don’t get bored!

If there is someone that you know you’ll miss very much you should take him with  you! – but you’ll have to hide him carefully.

So I hope you will have a good time in the moon and I hope that you will come back in one piece and say hello to the moon man for me!

Goodbye!
