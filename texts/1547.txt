Both players and people have different roles and duties to do and carry out something important.  The stage is the real life in reality where the players who are actually the people, in real life, have different roles, positions and tasks to do and dreams to fulfil in their society.

A player in a film or in a theatre, has a certain part and special role a different personality from his in his real life, therefore he has to separate between acting on stage and “acting in real life”, that mean doing another thing and being someone else and doing it or actually acting the role he had been asked to act.  So the part that he has been asked to do determine his role and his acting he becomes different person on stage who has to send a message or an aim to the audience and when he finishes his role he goes out from the stage, or when he finishes his part, he becomes a different person or actually he starts being himself he may have another part to play but in real life for his family for example he have to take care of his wife and children and be responsible or be very serious and tough with his children unlike his role in his play on stage so therefore these are the exits and the entrances he exits from his job that he has to fulfil and enters a new or different kind of “part” to his family.

Another important example in our society that is obviously seen is the doctor who has an extremely important and significant to play and to accomplish, give and do to his lacerate.  The doctor has a really hard part to “play” to do in his job who is in reality the stage, cause he has to be very acute, serious and smart he can be very strong and has a strong and serious personality and has to make drastic and important decisions that can make changes in people lives.  So it require from him to be awake all the time and be devoted but when he finishes his duty and go home or not being obligated to any more he become someone else maybe he can be very different act differently be very funny and very nice calm and not serious in real life so as a result he acts two parts which both are important.

So the result is that people have lot of part to do and act in they do it to help and serve there society.
