Lag Baomer is always one of the most enjoyable nights in the year, and I’m sure everybody else think so as well.

However, Lag Baomer that year was going to be something super-special (that’s was I had thought…).

It was going to be the first time…without parents!

“What a relief” I thought to myself, without aware that parents are always the same.

The preparations to the expected bonfire had started long time before (about a month).

With my feeling of independence, me and my class had collected great amounts of plants, so that the bonfire would be as big as possible, and we would be able to stay round the bonfire all along the nigh.

Thus, with great expectations, the big night arrived.  We organised the bonfire, and lit it up.  While passing rhea first hour, everything seemed to be alright.  In the second hour, a strange feeling was growing in my body.  Then, the third hour same, with me feeling somewhat worried I could see two people standing from a distance from the bonfire.  As they drew near, I easily identified them as my parents!  Then, when they say me astonished, they moved even faster towards me, their hands spread open, as if they wanted to hug me.

The only thing that I can remember from the incident, is that I should “Damn!  I knew it, I knew!  My reinforcements have arrived!!!  And I ran away from the bonfire as fast as I could, almost crying, and running to nowhere.

This incident was the most embarrassing one I have passed through my whole life.

My story has a lot in common with “All American Slurp”.  They both deal with embarrassing incidents, when a child is embarrassed by his parents.  Anyway, I find my story much more embarrassing than the sup incident, because in the restaurant the child was embarrassed near people who didn’t know him, and as against, I was embarrassed near my own class!!!!
