For I believe that good literature needs to reflect what the ordinary man or woman feels in different situations in life, but can never put into words to describe exactly how he or she felt at that particular moment.

And I believe that a good writer is one who can explore the maze of human emotions and being and eventually put that experience into words, to form that text that will take you beyond emotions, you already experienced. The kind of text that can make you experience love, though you have never been in love before that will make you doubt things you already have a preconceived notion about.



On a more personal level, I do not conceder myself, what is called a book-warm. Through out high-school I could never bring myself to finish reading a book after I started. But there was this phase in my life that I couldn't stop reading.


Looking back it was one of the hardest times in my life, if not the hardest. My father was diagnosed with ling cancer and became severely ill. I spent all of my time with my father, taking care of him and attending to all of his needs. It is not easy to see a beloved person fade away, knowing that there is little to do to save him. At that time I found refuge in books. I read day and night, none stop. I escaped reality into worlds of fantasy, not because I refused coming with it, but merely to provide to myself a refuge from the hard reality at that time.


And I'm grateful to a special person in my life, a deer friend that opened my eyes to the world of English literature, and made me aware of the existence of humorous good writers and books.


Who urged me to read and explore, a person that I was able to discus the books we read together.


At the end I would like to say, and from my own personal experience, that every book is a whole world waiting to be discovered.

Books can provide refuge and open up near worlds and I urge everyone to read and explore, including myself.
