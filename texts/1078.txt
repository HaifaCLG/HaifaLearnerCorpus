I was sitting now on the beach. The night was very dark and cold and the waves of the rough sea seemed like big frightened shadows. Where is he? I thought. To where could he disappear in this open beach? I looked at the sky and could see the moon go out from his hide between the clouds. Then I began to remember how much fun we had had together, to every where we  were going together and we were one to each other like the most good friend. I could remember how we went every day together to Moshe the milkman and how he liked to drink all the milk that Moshe didn't need. How will I live without him. And what will I say to my our parents. It began to rain and I felt how the tears covered my face. No, I mustn't cry. I won't leave here without him. I'll find him. But I looked for him every where. Where are you? I began to shout.  The absolute silence made me even more scared and my heart began to beat. Again the memories over came me. I began to miss the days we ate together every one from his plate and only yesterday I was playing the piano while he accompany my playing without words. No how did we loved each other. What will I do without you. I shouted But no answer was hear. I sat on the went grounds and gave up hope. That's it. My tears and the rain drop were every where and the sea continued to rough and rough just like my feelings. Suddenly I heard light steps approaching. My heart again beat but this time by hope. And yes, it was he he ran toward me and jumped on me. I hugged him with all my energy I felt his wet nose and I fell the most happy man in the world.  My dog Roky.
