My name is <NAME OMITTED> and I remember my self as a child. I didn't have very feelings like other children for example I didn't afraid from the darkness, from imagine things like monsters. The only thing that I remember of feelings was that my mother was angry with my because I have been loving her very much. So one day when my group of age from the village and I when to the orchard the leader of our group took us to the darkness in the orchards, and before he took us to there, he put a kafia on the main pipe that was in the orchards so when we got to this main pipe and say this kafia we that that this is an Arab man so we started to shouted and we started to run but was in a queue and was not all the group saw the Arab man. just in the middle of the group. So the started to ran and pushed the other that was before them and they just get to panic and started to run too and all of us fall on the leader that walk in the front he was so scared that he stated to scream too. in the end we got home very funny about what they have done to us that we asked from out leader to get another day to the orchards but he said no when we asked why he get away from it. I think because he really scared from us in there.
