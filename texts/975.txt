It was a school trip. We were very young only at the fifth class. We came back from a night walk with all of the class. We were sleeping in a motel. We went to the dining room to have dinner just before we got to sleep. While we were eating the teacher said that after ten clock no one is allowed to be out of bed and more than that we were not allowed to wall in the corridor. O course we haven't done as we were told. It was around midnight by that time and we were just coming back from the girls room. Suddenly we heard footsteps we ran back to our room. About half an hour later I opened the door and I saw a man at the end of the corridor. For an 11 year old kid it was frightening to think that the man would come to our room and probably catch us awake. Everybody got into the bed. Nothing. Once again I opened the door and a man was standing beside me. I jumped in the bed. Again nothing. Now I got up and the opened the door and the man jumped at me screaming. I was very frighten. The man told us to get into bed and to go to sleep. The is the most frightening experience I ever had.
