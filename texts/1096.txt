I have a very good friend, she called, Ofra. She is one of my best friends and I would like to tell about her because she is very simple woman, that I see as a very special one. Although Ofra is more than 40 years old it doesn't interfere the friendship between us. She has a very nice face, and green shining eyes. She is very kind and loving woman. The qualities I love in people are their having modesty and willingness to give. People that care about others and give themselves with no expectation to receive anything. One of the reason I like those qualities is that I don't have them myself and I'm trying and want to acquire. At the last time we haven't talked a lot together because I moved a house. But the moments I need her she always helped. She always relaxed me that every thing would be right and every thing she said was the true itself. Ofra doesn't have a husband. Her husband killed in the war. She has two children one is younger than me and the other one is older. She is an artist, she is doing very special things. Most of them is painting more than this she teaches children. Actually the way I met her. Just now I start to remember was because she taught my two little brothers. The children like her very much and feel like she is one of their friends. She has very good tact to them. I could say a lot of things about her but I don't remember all of them. I just want to add I met a very very special person that I lave very much.
