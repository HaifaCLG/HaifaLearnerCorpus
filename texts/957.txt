It was in the year 222. I was then 24 years old. One day I was walking in the street when I saw from the house I want never to smoke. That's goes out throw the window I went up there and I saw an old man by 61 years old. He was asleep. He had in his room a lot of stuff by a lot of colors green, white, blue, black. I got into the room and looked around. He told me that if I like I can fly with him to the past. We got into a little fast car and went to the year 1932 we land on a green grass that in our day isn't exist and we walk there and paper told us it is 1.2.1932and we went home. We push on the year 2222 and when we came back we are 3 days before. We are in the date 30.1.2222 and this was very interesting experience. It is another story
