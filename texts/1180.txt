I want to going to Hebron and my friends and help them to war to protect our land.

But we almost die, the land is more important from your life.

No, but god save us because he want that we protect our land, our land is holy land, we (the Jewish) don’t have another country, our country she’s very little and is important.

You always speak about the land, and how much the land is special.  But what about our life our family.

If we don’t help our friends to fight, to save our land, we lost our country.

I know that the country is very important, but we have to save our life before the country.

We have to do everything to save our country and to danger our life.

If your life isn’t important to you do it for me, and for your family, we have another land and space in this country, but you like one time, so come back.

You can go back home but I want go and fight with my friends.

Ok, you are my good friend and you are very important to me but I have to save my life, so I stay here and you can go to Hebron.  Good luck.

In our country there is argument about returns, there is people that they want in return for peace but there is the fear that the Arabs will ask for more returns and then take all our country.  So there is people that don’t want to give returns to the Arabs because the people think that the Arabs are unreliable and because they believe that the country is theirs and they didn’t have to give a return for the country.

I think that we need to give returns for peace for the Arabs but the peace have to be will and the Arabs have to give the same.
