There were two young kids, one was a girl and one was a boy. They were 16  old. The boy was called Danny and the girl was called Gilla. Danny loved Gilla very much, and Gilla loved him too, but their parents didn't like the friendship between them. So Danny's parents didn't allow him to meet Gilla, and Gilla's parents didn't allow her to meet Danny.


So they decided to run away from their home. At ten o'clock Danny stole his father's car, and he drove to Gilla's house where they decided to meet at half past eleven. At about one o'clock Gilla's parents discovered that their daughter is missing, they called to Danny's and asked from them to see if Danny is in his room. Danny's father went to see and he discovered too that his son is missing, they called the police and the police started to look for them but they didn't find them. At the morning when Gilla's parents make? Come she smelled something. She went to the garage and discovered that Danny and Gilla are in the car, and when she approached to the car, she saw that they dead - They committed suicide.


There are many kids who do such things because the acting of life doesn't seem to be good to them.
