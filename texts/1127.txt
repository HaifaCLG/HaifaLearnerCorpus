In the dark night of June, a man was seen walking through the forest. The animals did not pay much attention to this matter, even though people did not go into the forest very often. The man walked straight through the bushes and trees and he knew where he was going to.


After some time, he reached a small cliff no vegetation grew around it. The man looked around took a step forward and put his hand to his mouth. A strange sound was heard in the forest, somewhat like an owl but more intense and artificial. A secret door in the solid rock cliff opened and a small ugly creature came out "Who are you and what do you want", said the creature in a frightening? Demanding voice "I want to see the king of gnomes and who I am has nothing to do with you", "Wait said the gatekeeper and shut the door". After a while the door opened and the gatekeeper appeared "Come he said and come into the tunnel". The man followed, they passed through long corridors and chambers.


In the end, they came into a small room with a small stone table and a stone bed "Wait here tomorrow the king will see you" said the gatekeeper, went out of the room and shut the door.


The man looked the magic was done and many beautiful and famous people appeared, most of them were the ministers. When they all were out of the cave and safe in the woods. Alfonso threw the mushroom at the kind "that's from all of us!".
