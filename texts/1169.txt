I think that we need to give back Ramat Agolan for peace.


I don’t think that we need to give back Ramat Agolan for peace.


Why?  You doesn’t want peace with Arabic country.


Believe me I want peace with Arabic country I just don’t trust them.


Well, if you want a peace you need to give up like they give up.


You know that if they will be in the Ramat Agolan they can bomb with no problem.


Yes but we had to give them some chance.


I don’t think so..


Well what about the country.


It’s not good.


Why?


Because some people in government want to give back Ramat Agolan to Soria.


I think it’s ok for peace


Ok?  Donna maybe you don’t know but if we will back Ramat Agolan the Sorias people can bombs us because it’s mountain heights.


Look Donna, but we need to trust them.


Donna, before many years the Sorias people bombs Israel from The Golan Heights.
