Like all the frightening things, it happened at night. I live in a village and you probably know that its very dark and quite, and my village is near Arab village, many workers in the village are Arab. So I got back from a meeting with my girlfriend, on my way, I met another girl friend off my, we talk and it was already ten at night. Suddenly we heard a rustle from the plants. We was very frighten. After some minutes we heard it another time, and we saw someone with white shirt run between the trees. Then I separated from my girl friend, and start go to my home quickly. From time to time I heard the rustle. I got to my home and got in, every one else was sleeping, after some seconds maybe 30 bell off the door had rang who could it be? quietly I went to the door, opened it and it was no one. Till today I don't know who it was and I don't sure I should like to know.
