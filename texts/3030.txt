I eat a lot of food every day.
in the morning I drink tea and I have two sandwices in school time.
when I get home I eat lunch: meal + rice / pasta.
in the evening I eat big salad, but sometimes when we out of fresh vegetables I eat cornflakes.
I try not to eat junk food or sweets because Im on diat but sometimes I grab a cookie or a snak on the weekends I eat a bit more because I'm in the house all day and free, and the boring makes me go to the kitchen all the time.
also, almost every friday we go to a friend's house and eat a lot of snaks.
I know that breakfast is the most important meal in the day, because it gives you energy for the rest of the day, but I like the lunch meal more because it is tastier.
I like the most: pastas and soups and dont like cheeze.
