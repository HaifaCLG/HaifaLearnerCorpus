I started new year in the synagogue it was Friday evening.  In the synagogue were all my family and the usual people that come to pray every week.  But I see a lot more people that they not coming to pray every week or day.  The pray was much longer than usual.

Right after the pray all my family and I went to my grandfather and grandmother house.  The table was already set with all the food on it.

We have all sit down on the table.  We did prayer on wine  and bread cut.  Before we eat we done the new year songs  and ate sweet apple with the honey on it.

On the morning I went again to pray and I ate again and the next day happens the same.
