Everybody gave their ideal of house which is different from one person to another.  So this is my house of dreams.

My house of dreams should be on a remote island on the continent of Asia.  It should be a beach house which is near to the sea with good white sand.

The interior of the beach house should look pretty much common, without too much luxuries, the walls will be painted with soft colours like cream and the furniture should be made from wood.

In the beach house the windows will be big and high-tech communication that is needed and a well-equipped kitchen is also very important.

A pool or a car are not needed in place like this but a decent boat is very important because itâ€™s the main transportation in this part of the world.
