Dear Eli,
I just got a lot of money for my birthday from my uncle who lives in the USA. He said that he is sorry for not coming to Israel to celebrate my birthday so he sent me money that I can buy with it whatever I want.
I bought some clothes and the rest of the money I gave my parents to put in the bank. I could also give the money for charity but I think I would need that money later.
What would you do if you get a lot of money too?
Love 4 ever,
