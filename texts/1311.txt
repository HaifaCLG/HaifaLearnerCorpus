On the left there is a tangerine and an apple to its right.  Behind the apple, a white milk jug and a candle next to it.  In front of the candle which is held a very nice candle, a cup and saucer, and in front of them, another tangerine, a yellow one.  To its right, a little plate with a pink napkin, a knife and one more and last tangerine on it.  Behind the plate a silver butter dish and behind that, a beautiful vase. In the vase are flowers.
