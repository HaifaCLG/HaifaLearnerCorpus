Before 2 month I went to a special trip in this trip our group learned to do snappling. We went to a high rock in Migdal Zedek and a club of people that like snappling had teach us how to do that. We had to slide from a rock that his height was 30 meters. I was very frightening and I though to myself that something must happens to me when I will slide. So after we learned how to slide we had to do that, I got close to the rock and began to slide. I think that I came into a panic and I forgot all the rules of snappling and I did something wrong and I found myself stuck in a high of 15 meter without no rock beside me. In the moment I began to shout, it was very frightening but the man that send me didn't heard me I describe to myself what will happened to me, when will they will come to rest me or what my frightening mother will said about that. After some minute I think that I began to enjoy because all the children were looking at me and the view was very beautiful. I began to talk with the children that slide in their over rope. After all some man at the club come near to me and said to me how to rescue myself and I carried on and I came in safely in the ground. I was stack in the middle of the rope for 15 minutes everyone said that it could be very frightening, but I enjoyed for that.
