Overcrowding in the classroom â€“ to split and teach in two shifts or not?

On the one hand the disadvantages for this solution.  One is that the teacher will be able to give personal care to each of the students.  The second is that the class will be quieter so the teacher will succeed to teach more subjects.

On the other hand, there are number of disadvantages for this solution too.  The children that study in the morning will be more alert and will concentrate more.  The kids that will study in the afternoon will be more tired and therefore, will concentrate less.

In conclusion, I think that we can come up with a better idea that will help the pupils more.
