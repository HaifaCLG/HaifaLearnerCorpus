Listen my little son. It was 20 years ago. I was only 15 years old. I had liked that time very much basketball. I played a lot and went to basketball matches too. I have always dreamed to meet face to face the players of Maccabi Tel Aviv who were the champions of Israel in basketball.
Also that I went to many matches like I already said, I didn't manage to meet my great players. Yes, my son, it was my dream. One day my father told me that I can write a letter to Maccabi's manager and to ask him if I can meet them in one of there practices. The answer was yes. So, on a beautiful afternoon we went I and my father to meet them. It was really exciting. I felt that my dream came true and I was very happy.
