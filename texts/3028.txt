Dear Lee,
How are you? I'm OK.
I want to tell you that I was getting a very much money in sunday.
Until now I give helf in this money to chordy and in the another half I was thinking what to do. What you think that should I do? What do you do if you get this money? I think to save this money to medical school after the army.
see you soon, <NAME OMITTED>
