Once I used to laugh on every teenager that was all the time depressed and walked around with a gloomy face. It's ridiculous – we are just boys and girls that in the beginning of the way to be grow up, and we haven't got the problems of economical and supporting family, like our parents have.


When I started to develop a relationship with a boyfriend, it develops to something serious and I was happiest girl in the world. I couldn't hear problems of my girlfriends, because I didn't understand them – I saw everything "in those colored glasses". But like in the end of everything good after a year that we stay together, he moved to Raanana and we had to part.


At that day I thought that my whole world fell apart. All the time I was lost in my thoughts. My friends worried about me and take me to go out, and it didn't help me.


Time goes on, and I understood that I cannot to be all the time in depressing.


I am still young and I must to take advantage of every minutes that in this beautiful age.
