How are you? There lot of time we won't met. Yesterday was my 12 birthday. I was very sad you couldn't come. It was very fun. averyone told it to me. My family gave me lot of money and my friends too. My grandmother and my grandfather gave me 500 shekels. My aunt gave me more 200 shekels. It's allready a lot of money: 700 shekels.
Together my all best friends gave me 600 shekels. Now I have 1,300 shekels. I am very happy. Of course I got many presents too but it for other letter. I allready want to see you. I hope we meet soon.
