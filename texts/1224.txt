It’s a sad story about a problem boy mother why aren’t your taking you homework to boy I did my homework before I get here. Are you sure . did I lay to you once in my life. I can remember a lot for times. So I lay to you a few times so what.

So I think I can’t trust you anymore .

Then don't trust me. I am going out tonight.

You have a test tomorrow.

I don't have one.

You can go out but don't come back late.

I come back with my friends when they come back.

You are not all your friends.

Please don't be like that .

Tonight I will give you to come home late because it’s the new year.

I don't want it to repeat  on itself.

What I think about it.

I think the mother should be more harder on her son.
