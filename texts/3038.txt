When I was 12, my parents decided at my bat mitzva we will flew to Paris. I was very happy and I was wiiting my bat mitzva very much. unfortunattly it was in 2006 when the war began and all the big freedom from school was sad. but in the end of the war we flew to paris to one week and it was my first experience abroad. I saw many musiums, palaces, and the Aifel tower when we arrived to Israel the war ended and the school started.
