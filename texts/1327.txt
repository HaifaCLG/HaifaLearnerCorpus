Technology has always been a part of my life.  When I was born, appliances like computers and televisions werenâ€™t so rare.  But as I grew up everything started to get faster.  Computers have become smaller, smarter, faster and stronger.  Televisions have become bigger, more flat and in better quality.  And because of all these advanced instruments they started to have a bigger part in our life time.  We can now spend hours and hours just watching TV or playing on the computer.  We even take our cell-phone with us just when throwing out the trash.  Technology is not a dirty or bad word, but sometimes it seems we had rather not have it.

Despite the disadvantages, there so much you can have now that it would look impossible not to have technology.  However, I try not always to use machines.  When something can be done by hand I prefer not to use some kind of an instrument.  I think that the fact that I play the guitar rather than create music on the computer, like electric music/trances, is something that technology would never change.
