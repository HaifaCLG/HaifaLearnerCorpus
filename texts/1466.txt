I have been to England three years ago and I remember it like it happened yesterday.


I was with some friends and got to know new English friends whom in touch by sending mails to each other. It was very good to me to live for a while in a different environment to be in new places and meeting new people and to get familiar with different cultures. One of the things that I liked there that we have been to a small Town called Beverly we stayed in college dwarfs called Bishop Burton. There was a farm with horses and a river by. And when we went shopping I liked the streets there, which are calmed, and clean and very small. I also wont  forget the beautiful large churches we visited there it was amazing. This experience I  will never forget and just left to wish to travel to there again
