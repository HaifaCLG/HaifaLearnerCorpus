Abot a year ago I had a trip to Thailand for my bar Mizva. Before the trip we organized clothes, medications and ourselves for the trip. We flew with an organized group so almost everything was ready for our arrival a bus and a hotel room. During the trip we visited all kinds of historical sites, Budhist temples, we saw elephants play soccer and one of them even lifted and puted me inside his mouth, but that awas only for a picture, it was a traind elephant. To sum up Thailand is great, beatiful and huge country, and I also learned that in Thailand they don't eat dogs.
