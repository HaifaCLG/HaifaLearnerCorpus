I want to give my opinion on the suggestion, that classes be split and taught in two shifts, half the class in the morning and the other half in the afternoon.  I think this is unreal suggestion.  They are some reason why, and I am going to mention two of them.

First of all most of the people cannot think clearly in the afternoon.  That fact show that students will not get a good grade if they learn in the afternoon. Moreover, if the class be split and taught in two shifts, the students will not see each other every day.  I think they will not agree that such thing will happen.

To summarise, I think this idea is not the solution.  If you do not think like me, you have your right to think different but this is my opinion.
