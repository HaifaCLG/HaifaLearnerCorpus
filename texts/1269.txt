In this composition I am going to write about a difficult task that I've just completed.  The task is that I have finally finished taking all my Bagrut examinations.

I feel so great about it.  I've never thought I would feel like that.  I've been waiting to this moment for 12 years and finally it's here.  Now that tit happens, I feel, on the one hand, happy that I finished but on the other hand there is sadness that it's all over now.

Now that the Bagrut examinations is over, I think that my life will be less stressful.  Now, I'll have more time to myself and hanging with my friends

I think that I'll celebrate this occasion by doing a big party in my house or going to the beach and having barbeque.
