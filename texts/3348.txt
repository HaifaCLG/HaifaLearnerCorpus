In the end of the week I eat more vital food, and more then usual.
we eat every meal with the family.
My favourite meal is pizza or rise and shnizel. its very tasty and MAS'BIA	. The food I can't eat and don't like is espacially onion.
Even when I was younger I hated it, I couldn't even see it, and when I tried to eat it I threw up.
I can eat onion just in salad.
