Nowadays, the whole world is full of essential objects and things that we just can not live without them. A brilliant and new invention is born to the world almost every day. There are lots of important things in my live that I will not be able to scarify them because, I can not live without them such as: water, the air condition, television, DVD or video, cars, telephonesâ€¦



However, my most important gizmo is the Internet. When we first learned about the Internet at school, I didn't like it. I thought it is a stupid invention that can not benefit at all. I found it hard to understand how to use the internet, how to search information and how to deal with it in general. However, nowadays it's different. Fortunately, I changed my mind about the internet (I also had to change my mind). Suddenly I looked at the internet as an incredible and amazing invention. I discovered the advantages of it. The first thing that I did afterward was to create my own Email. Maybe it didn't go on so well because, I forget my password. As a result my Email was deleted because I couldn't open it for 30 days.


I almost changed my mind again about this invention. But, it didn't happen.

I did give up though on creating my own Email. One day one of my class mates, who are a "computer genius" asked if I need help. Five minutes later I had an Email address and messages from my friends in my inbox.

Since 9th grade until today I have the same Email address. I surf the net almost every day. I got used to the internet. Nowadays, when I have an assignment to submit I will not start to do anything with the assignment until I surf the net and get information on it.


It's hard to believe how much power the Internet has. We can find everything we think of, desire, and dream. We can even be whoever we want and choose. The Internet will bring the whole world to your home and will provide whatever your eyes wish to see on your screen.
