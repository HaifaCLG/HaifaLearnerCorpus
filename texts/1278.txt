Overcrowding in the classroom is well-known phenomenon.  In this days one solution has been suggested.  Split the classes.  I don't agree with this solution at all.  I don't think it is a good idea.  When we check this solution, we realize it has it's advantages and disadvantages.  On the one had the solution is useful because of the way the pupil will learn.  Firstly,  the pupil after the splitting will be more concentrate than before.  Secondly, they will feel more comfortable to ask for help.  Moreover, the pupil probably will succeed in their tests than before.  On the other hand, the splitting will cause social problems.  The pupils don't get used to each , because they don't meet their friends.  In addition, the splitting is kind of punishment and misery for the pupils.

As I see it, this idea is more harmful than useful.
