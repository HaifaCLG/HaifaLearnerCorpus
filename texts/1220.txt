lior, what you say about the Golan argument and the demonstration about it?

Noam, my friend, I have just wake up now, and you ask me about the Golan?

Come on, you know how much this subject important to the government and to the people who live there!

I don’t know if you forget, but I remind you anyway – I don’t live in Golan, and it’s not disturb me what happen there.  I just want to come back to my home, to Herzilya, so take me now, and stop talk about this!

How can I don’t talk about this?  It’s the most important thing that going now, I just  ask you, to know what you think about the Golan.

So now you know what I think, I have nothing to do there, and it’s not interesting me at all!

I can tell you something about the Golan?  If you don’t know, your favourite place in the Golan

And what is my favourite place, my friend, as you know I have many place that I love to be in there.

How could you tell that?!  You forget that we had been last week in the Hermon, and there you tell me:  Lior, in now and ever, it’s be my favourite place and now what you say about the Golan?

I sure, you didn’t know that the Hermon is in the Golan!  Naom, I apologise to you, now I know that all you saying now, you right about them, but I’m going to return to my deep sleep and dreamed about the … Hermon
