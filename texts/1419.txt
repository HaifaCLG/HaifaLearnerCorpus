The first impression i got entering "Seminar Hakibbutzim" is a very peaceful and tranquil feeling, being surrounded by patches of grass, tall trees, flowers, bushes and wood benches. This isn't just the atmosphere it's really what you see when you look around. I remember on my first day seeing a dozen gardeners walking around, discussing important issues like: where shall I place the lawn mower? And so on. It seemed to be a serious group of people. Moreover, the seminar takes this issue very seriously.

As you enter from the main entrance, you see the large yard in front of you. It has green grass and tall trees that you can lean on or enjoy the shade they provide. This area is at its best on breaks. Groups, pairs and solo's gather around. Laying, sitting ,eating their sandwiches, drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette forgetting for just a few minutes where they are, some use the yard for sleeping on a free lesson, reading a book or doing some home-work.

Do not be mistaken the rest of the seminar is not neglected. Almost each building has a few trees, benches, small gardens, waiting to be visited in between lessons. It seems like the Seminar's pride and joy. Making us feel more in a Kibbutz then in the middle of Tel- Aviv.
