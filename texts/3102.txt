In the end of 2008 I've been threw a car accident. When I got to a zebra cross. I ride on bycicle and I got hit by a car. An Ambulance got very quickly because one of the near neibers called him, and another person took my phone and called my mother. I broke my hip very badly and after two seurgry and one year everything worked out when my mother get ot the place she was very scard for me because I had a very dificult time to breath. All my family was worry about me but everything is ok naw.
