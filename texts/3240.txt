When I was 7 years old I had the greatest birthday ever. I remember waking up at 7:00 with rollers in my hair so I had crazy curles.
then we (my dad, mum and I) got ready and called to the minibus that picked me and my fried on the way. we ware abought 25 kids (2 minibuses) it was crazy the ride was so mutch fun then we arived to the zoo we saw bears an liones and monkies then we went to eat in macdonalds and all the kid puted their chips in one big pile and puted ketchup on it and it looke like a big chips volcano, that was hilurius.
