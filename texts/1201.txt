Recently we are witnessed to a rise of violence  at the families, with no connection to social economy.

I live in Hadera and some months ago, there was murder of wife by her husband that kill himself after his action.  I think that this example show us the low moral in our society.  It’s now not logic that every day we see article that discuss on woman that murder or man who burn his wife and children, what is going on?  Is the low system or the police don’t cope well with this subject?

I feel bothered every time I see this subject leaf on the newspaper, and when this is happen close to my living place, I really afraid, be where the violence expansive to every where.  We need to be with careful, what will be the next event.
