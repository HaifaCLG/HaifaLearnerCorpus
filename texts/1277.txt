Yesterday I did my last Bagrut examination, and I can't even imagine for you how it feels like.  12 years I've learned and now it's over and I'm feeling relieved.

Unfortunately my life isn't going to change a lot and soon I'll have more examination.

I'm planning to go to the university for learning economic and business management so it's not even started and the hard work is still in front of me.  Anyway until it begun I'll enjoy my free time in going to trips, visiting my uncles who lives in the north and sleeping till late just as I like.  I want to give a rest to my body and my mind and relax from all the stress that I was in.
