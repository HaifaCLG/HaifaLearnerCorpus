My friends and I sitting around with a group of fellow soldiers remembering the good old days: The day in school before very good days. We're went to the trips, we went to the movies and do everything we wanted. Its became beautiful days, we smiled and don't worry. And now we are sitting near and in home waited our families. We have many children, wife and we worry to money and food. When we become to school, we become young children but in past we don't liked school and we don't liked go to school. And now we are sitting near and remember when all good days?
I remember at Arik he fat boy and very funny, and one day he felt and heat the teacher to history and it was very funny. And I remember Rachel the teacher of English, She loved Yarden so much and give to her 10 in her diplomat end the semester. It was a beautiful day and so what him pity them past.
