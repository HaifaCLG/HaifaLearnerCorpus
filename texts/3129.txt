The special event in my life was my brother "bar mitzva". In this even the whole family was anacted. The prepers for this event took a lot of time for our life but in the end it was a great party.
At the begining of the party it was stressful, we all was very nervous that a lot of people will come. After my brother speach we went to dance, it was really fun. In the time that we were dancing the young people of the family drink some alcohol drinks and they were really drunk.
It was very funny to see young and drunk people dancing like crazy people.
The event was secsesful and we had alot of fun, and we kind of happy that it's end because it was stressful.
