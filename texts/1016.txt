I dance in a folk dance group. In the summer we flew to Spain for two festivals: the first festival was a competition and the second was a regular one. Between the festivals we traveled a lot in Barcelona, Granada and more one day before we traveled to the second festival we stopped in Madrid there we saw a statue of Don Quixote and Sanshe Pantcho and a beautiful fountain. We got dawn to took a picture and to rest. I with few friends got into the fountain to have some fun and then it happend I run around and I cut my finger from the hospital I sent with crutches and my leg was bandaged and very heart. I didn't know what would happened in the second festival. The week after was very disappointed all my friends were playing, seeming and have fun and I was sitting and take care of there begs. The time for the first show in the second festival was getting close, I was hopping that my finger will get better. The first show was fast and in the second show in that evening I was going to the hospital, the doctor was checking my leg and took of.
