Before two month, it was Friday night and I planned to go out. I wait for my friends to come and pick me. At the meantime I sitting in my living room and watch television. After ten minutes the phone rang. I picked it up and say hello the person who rang me up asked to talk with someone who called Sharon. I said that its the wrong number. The man on the other line asked me if I'm sure. I don't know how, but we started to talk and I gave him my telephone number and took him. We started to talk almost every day. After one an a half month we decided to meet. The trouble is that I had doubts about this idea. At last I said o.k. We had a date in a cafe. I got there first. I sat in a chair and waited. We said that he will come with a sun glasses so I could recognize him. After 5 minutes someone with a sun glasses come in after he took off his glasses I was very surprised. It was my best child friend.
