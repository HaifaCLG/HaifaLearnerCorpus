The first day in the six class was very bad. I wouldn't forget it for a lot of time. It happened like this. We came to school it was Sunday. The first class was with Benny he teach us language, he started with learning all the names of the boys and girls in class. After this he told us what he want from us he told that he want us to be good to try hard and also that we re not little children we are in the sox class we are big boys now. After this he told us how he is giving the grades. One lesson past and off in the second lesson we had gym and the teacher started to learn the names too after this he told us that we are not a little boys we are in the six class we had to try hard after this he told us how he is giving the grades too. The two hour after were mathematics lessons the teacher came to us and learn the names of the boys and girls after it she told us that we are not a little boys we are in the six class we had to try hard after saying this she told us â€“ you know- How she is giving the grades.
