I want to tell you about my uncle wedding (Yossi). In the start of the celebrite, the CHUPA was started and it was very excited to me, all the time I were with my sister michal, we danced together, and eat a lot... My mother was cried when her brother yossi broke the glass.
a very good music was played, we danced with our family, the food was tasty.
I remember when we danced, someone DACHAF me very hard and i felt (NAFALTY) on the floor, and everybody was laugh at me. It was fanny.
I will remember it forever.
