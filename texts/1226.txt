Come, let’s go home, we had a long day.

We did had a long day, but I want to go to Hebron anyway.

What are you?  Nuts!  Our car is broken I’m tired and exhausted.  I want to go home.

I you want to home go alone with the policeman.  I wanted to go to Hebron for demonstration and I still want to go.  You go I will take tramps to Hebron.

Crazy, you are crazy.  How can it be that after that kind of event, terrorism, you still want to go to that crazy territory and don’t want to come to your safe nice home.

If we will go back home, it means that it all happened for nothing.  I going to Hebron no matter what!

You aren’t understandable.

What?!!!

I don’t understand.  How a man after that kind of event still want to go to a place that (for my opinion) full of dangerous people.

I care for my country.

I care before I care now and I will care tomorrow, today I can rest.

Excuse me officer, could you arrange me a lift for Hebron.

Sure, come with me I’m on my way to there.

Fine with me, I going home.

Bye, say hi to your wife.

Bye.
