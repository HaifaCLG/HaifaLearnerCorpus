Two month ago was Passover, we were celebrate the Fact that Israel get out from Egypt, in the evening all the family sat around big table and we all read the 'hagada', while we reading the 'hagada' we drink 6 tiny wine glass.
The food that was served was the traditional food of Passover, and ofcourse Mazzot.
While the evening my grand father hid the 'afikoman', he probably didnt remember hwere does he hid the 'afikoman' last year, and he hid the afikoman of this year at the same place of last year. All the children didnt knew where the 'afikoman' hidden, and all the family laugh when she saw where the 'afikoman' was hidden.
