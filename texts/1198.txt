A story that was written in the newspaper is about one man who burned alive his own wife and his two children one morning in their own house.

Each day when we open the newspaper, we heard about lots of  cases in which the man in the family hits his wife and his children and sometimes it even gets worse like in the example.  I think that this is a very big problem in our society and we need to stop it an prevent it from developing more, otherwise more people will get ideas from other cases and will think that they allowed to act the same.
