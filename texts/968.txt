I am a guide in a youth movement in my village. I want to tell you about meeting with my apprentice last week. I come to our meeting place five minutes before it is beginning. I was out the club. Only the other guide was in there. Everything was quiet. The other guide said to me, come in the club, but be careful. I came down the stairs. I came in. The room was dark, I hear only muttering. Suddenly somebody throw to me a ball. Then my apprentice open the electric light and they sing songs to festival month, and we eat a dry fruits . All of us was very happy.
