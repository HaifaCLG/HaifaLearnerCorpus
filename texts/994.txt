It happened to me at the last summer vacation, I looked for something interesting to do during the holiday. Then I found that there's a special course on the T.A. university it's topic was a film makers course. I went to the course, the first days were awful, the course was very interesting (we studied about Woody Allen and saw some of his movies) but the people looked to me very stupid, after three days of Woody Allen we started practicing. We had to bring a new script every day,  we made some very short movies (2 minutes) without sound. Then we decided that we want to do a long movie (7 - 9) minutes, everyone of us had to write a script and then we choose the best of them. Finally the chosen one was mine. It was very bad some foolish story about pupil who wants to get to the movie class at time but somehow gets involved in all possible difficulties. I was the director I had an assistant, Art directors, script girl and of course the photographer. I was in a great pressure during the shouting and I've had some of the most nervous days of my life. Finally, we finished the movie I have it on a cassette but I'm not giving to show anyone.
