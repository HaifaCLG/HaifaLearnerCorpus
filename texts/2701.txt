Hi Dan.
As you know, I celebrated my birthday last week.
my parents and my grandmothers and greandfathers gave me some money. my parents gave me 500 shekels and my grandmothers and grandfathers gave me 1000 shekels at all.
I think about using this money for some of this options: maybe I will buy a SLR camera which will help me to caught beautiful pictures on our trip to England on the next month.
other option is to buy a lcd television to my room which will replace my old CRT TV.
there is a way that I will buy flying yoke and pedals for my computered flight simulator. this flying yokee and pedals will help me to simulate as much as I can the real\ flying life.
me and my friends want to buy a poker table and playing chips for our friday poker games, which are fun and free to play on and on. we always invite a delicious pizza and eat it while watching a dvd movie. so there is a chance that I will use this money for covering my part on this deal.
Maybe I will use this money for go on a vacation on Eilat with my frinds, but I afraid my parents will not allow me to go on this vacation.
I think about buying a sport kite or a model airplane, which I will able to fly it in the free nature or in the beach.
I am thinking seriously about taking a wave surfing course because this sport seems me very intaresting, or to use this money for a flight over israel's sky.
But, it seems that I will put the money in the bank as in every year. so the money will help me in the future.
