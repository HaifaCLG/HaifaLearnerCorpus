Hello Yossi.

*first i decimeld (i gave a donation to someone) and i gave it the the anti cancer organization.
*then i bought stamps (i collect them, remember) in 12 grands worth and im really happy about it
*i planed a vacation in the people republic of china (or just china) who stats in Beijing and end in shanghai and maybe even in Macao in the rest of the money.
