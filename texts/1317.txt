Do you familiar with the feeling that everybody in the room look at you like you fell from the moon?

A really embarrassing incident happened to me when I was in a restaurant with my parents.  When we were there, we ordered a glass of cola for any of us.  When the glasses arrived, we started to drink, and then my mother’s glass fell from the table on one of the customers that passed near our table.  The man was very angry and started to shout at my mother.  All the customers looked at us and were very embarrassed and after this incident we left the restaurant and the man stopped to shout at us.

Now, when I write about this incident, I remembered at the story, “All American Slurp”.  My feelings was the same of the feelings of the speaker in the story, both of us were very embarrassed because of our parents’ behaviour.  But we and my family were so embarrassed, that we decided to leave the restaurant as soon as we could.  This incident made me to act very carefully in restaurants, because I really don’t want another embarrassing incident.
