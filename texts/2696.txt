Dear Daniel,
Yesterday at my birthday, I got 3,000 NIS from my family and my friends.
I think that I will save that money for driving lessons in the future, or maybe I'll buy a new computer, but it depends on my parents opinion.
Personally, I prefer to buy a new computer.
Anyway, I'll do good things to me with this money.
Hope to hear from you soon,
