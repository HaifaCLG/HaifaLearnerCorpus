Today I have finished my last Bagrut examinations.  I feel so happy that I cannot describe it.  I and my friends have decided to go the sea.  I worked hard and I hope I would get a good grades.  After a month I will get the grades.  If they are like I hope they are, I will go learn something in the university, in order to get a job.  I think it will be history, because I love history.  Till then I am going to help my mother in her work.  I also want to go to trips in my beautiful country.  I hope I would see how much I can and come home safely.
