in the morning I love to eat cornflakes and milk. In the afternoon I love to eat Schnitzel and chips, hamburger, spaghetti, Shawarma and a lot of things.
In the evening I love to eat egg, toast, egg, soup
my favorite food is Schnitzel and chips / hamburger and chips. sometimes I eat chicken but I don't very like it. I love fries because is tasty, I love pasta and Schnitzel but just of my mom or dad, because they make it the best, they know how to cook.
