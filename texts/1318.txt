Did it ever happen to you?

A few years ago, I went with my brother to a restaurant and as usual, he started to embarrass me, to insult me, while he thought it was funny, but it wasn’t.  After he finished to make a joke of everything I did, we sat down and ordered.  When the food arrived, he started to play with his food, like he was a little idiot child, he ate with his hands and with his mouth open, and he also slurped!  Can you believe that?!  So I started to punch him, so he would stop embarrass me, but he didn’t stop, so I ran into the bathroom.  I waited there for about an hour.  I was so ashamed!!

I think that we felt the same feelings embarrassed, ashamed we both wanted to get the hell out of the restaurant, and we both ran into the bathroom.
