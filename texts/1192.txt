I want to stop all the masquerade so we will make a deal with you – I will leave my phone open and you will sleep with no worries.


And you will go out just when you to such late hours and don’t have school in the day after.,  Goodnight.  Oh, we still grounded you for a week.


You’re cynic, aren’t you?



For my personal experience I can tell that my parents are very nice people and trust me a lot.  My sister is moist of the problem.  She is 21 years old and the problem is about the phone.  She talks for hours and don’t answer waiting calls and my parents upset because of that.  They are paying huge sum of money every month and she doesn’t pay any attention.  I can understand her because both of us are very communicative people but I still can wait until 22:00 so it’s cheaper.


6 month ago we got huge pay phone and my parent burst so they didn’t agree to pay and we didn’t have phone for a whole month.


I was very angry because it wasn’t really my fault.  The good thing is that the house was very quiet without the ringing and shouting but it was terrible to be unconnect.  After that event my sister calm down a bit and now we have an agreement that above X bill, we ask a report from Bezeq and everyone pay his part.  Thank God it’s still works and we have phone and quiet.
