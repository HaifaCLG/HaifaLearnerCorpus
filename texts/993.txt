It happened two month ago in school Daniel asked me to bring to school two batteries I taught he is laughing  with me but he didn't in the next day he asked me in the second time if I brought them I told him that I didn't. He told me that he brought a little bomb and he need the batteries to explode the bomb. Then he asked some other kids if they have batteries but they didn't have. Then he took the little bomb  and with some other kids he tried to explode the bomb with fire in the beginning the bomb didn't explode but after 4 lessons in 11.50 Saar and me went to the little cafe we saw him and we went  to talk with him and in exactly 11.55 the bomb exploded I was very frightening then I started to run it was a big explosion. I don't now how much kilometers I ran like 5 or 7 kilometers I thought that someone is hurt or someone been out after 20 seconds I return to school I asked Saar where Daniel he told me that he don't know I thought that a hundred of policemen are coming after me I didn't know went to do Benny came to teach us I didn't late to the lesson. After the lesson Daniel came back a anted to kill him. I asked him if he know what is going to happen he didn't knew too. But it over now the policeman that came to school new what happened and Daniel told them that he brought the bomb because he didn't wanted to loss a lot friend.
