Dear Friend,
Yesterday I was celebrating my 16 birthday.
All my family was here and they all brought me presents.
My uncle decide to suprise me and bring me 1500 shekels and he was telling me to spend it all on clothes and stuff.
For now I didn't touch the money but I have a big dilemma I don't know if I should spend the money on clothes like I was told to, or save it for the trip to Eilat on the next holiday.
What were you doing instead of me?
I think I will go on the clothes option, I need new clothes.
Miss you...
