My name is <NAME OMITTED>. I am almost 16 years old. I have being lived in Petach-Tikva since I was a baby. This year we moved to Nirit, a new place, its not so far from city but don't have any transportation, except of once a day, and we don't have any transportation, except of once a day and we don't have a phone except for one poor public telephone that usually doesn't work. One day I was in good mood and wanted to visit my old friend in Petach Tikva. I phoned to her and told her I would come to her, but she wanted to come to Nirit, because she didn't know the new place I live in. I told her to come with the one only bus and that arrives once a day and if I wont see her in the bus I'll come to her. I waited the bus and as I expected she didn't come and I entered the bus and arrived the city. As I arrived her home I didn't see anyone in her house. So I sat down to write her a note, and wanted to go other place. Suddenly her mother arrived, she I told her everything and she became very frightened because Nirit is full of Arabs and so all we started to worry my friend. I was sure she didn't come to Nirit because the wasn't any other bus that come to Nirit. I phoned to the public phone and no body answered I wanted to check if she arrived. Later I tried again and I heard her voice I was shocked. What are you doing there I said How did you arrive. So I she started to tell me she missed the bus and got on bus that arrived a place that very closed to Nirit and had a tramp to Nirit. It was amusing and disappointed at once. So long the time I haven't seen her and how she is in Nirit and I'm in her house, without any choice to meet.
