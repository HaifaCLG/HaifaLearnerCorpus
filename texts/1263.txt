After 12 years in school and much more Bagrut examinations, I feel so relief without any signs of pressure.  Finally feel that I can breathe in and out peacefully.

From now on I am on a new road, living the old one behind me as a beautiful memory of childhood.

My life will definitely change, whether for good or for bad I donâ€™t know, but I hope it would be better.  I plan to go to the army and to do my best in order to succeed and help others.  After my military service I hope I would start me studies at the university.  From this point God and life would show my me destination.

If somebody ask my how I plan to celebrate the end of part one in my life together with a new beginning, I would take him to party with me.  Eventually I would celebrate in some way with my close friends.
