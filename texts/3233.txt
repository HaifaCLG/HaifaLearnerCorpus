Morning is the most horrible part of the day. It should be cancelled due to the lack of interest, cause nobody realy loves to wake up at 6 am with the shrill sounds of the alarm. On the other hand, nobody would like it vice versa... so the rolling ouit of bed process is a much hated must. I get up at 6 am every morning. The moment I open my eyes I regret it immideately - all of a sudden I feel quite aware of my body which huts, stiffens, and does every thing possible to make me realize that it was a bad moment to wake up. Sadly, bus schedules tend to disagree with this policy, and I get up shivering all over. My general appearance in the mornings could have seared the bravest of wild beasts and make them stick to the sidelines with their tails between their legs. It takes a solid vision of drowsy beauty. The next 5 minutes are dedicated to a short distance run (the emphasis is put on the speed) to the bus stop. Most of the times I am lucky enough to catch the bus and get to school on time.
