I the year 2002 their were Passover holiday, me and my family look arond and arond and we can't find the "Aphikoman".
We looked in the kitchen in the living room in the bathroom and nobody could find the "Aphikoman".
All the family tryed to give as hints in SAFOT that we cant understand.
After hours of lookin arond my uncle Eran put his hand in his pocket and took out the "Aphikoman".
