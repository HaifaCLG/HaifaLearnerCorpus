I was born in a small village in the north of Israel (a kibbutz). My mother was born in Sweden and my father in Israel. I have two sisters and one brother and I'm the second child among us four.

During the last six or seven years I was traveling around the world and lived in different places in Israel and abroad. In Israel: I lived in the desert in a camel farm and also in a village by the sea. I went to Australia for a year or so. I rode a bicycle from Sydney to Melbourne, which took about a month. I also traveled in New Zealand for a couple of months with 3 wonderful friends I met on that trip and with whom i maintain very close relationship until now.

I lived in Denver, Colorado for a year as well and returned to Israel about a year ago. On my way back to Israel, I traveled in central America (Guatemala, Mexico and Honduras) for three months. Then, just before I really settle back in Israel, I visited London for a week, paying a visit to some dear old friends.

And now I'm here, in Tel-aviv, where I moved to study. I visit the north (my other home) once in every couple of weeks or so. I decided to study English teaching in Hakkibutzim college of education. I live in a cozy apartment near the college, which I share with my friend Maya, who was my flat mate also 8 years ago when we were serving in the army together and lived in a city called Rishon le Zion.

I ride my bicycle to school every morning, a 5 minutes ride across the park.

I quite enjoy my studies, although I seemed to have more energy to invest in it last semester.

I appreciate music: I sing and I love listening to my CDs. I also enjoy reading books and exercise sports.

I would like to find someone here in this forum, whom I could share my opinions with and react to his/hers.
