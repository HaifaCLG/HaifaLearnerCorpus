Once I had an unlucky dog. When I was younger about 3 years ago I had two dogs. One was very old and was ready to die the other one was a puppy a very young one. The two dogs like each other and played together from the early morning to the late evening. But the big black young dog was kept in a kennel and the other little old brown dog was free. One day while the young dog was in his kennel the old one was poisoned so he spit it out but it was too late the dog was dead. So we sadly buried him on the tall hill behind our house, but in our hearts we knew that he was any way ready to go. Just when the old dog spit the poison out the young one was at his kennel ready for lunch but that day he was so hungry that he got free and the first thing he saw was the spit out poison he ate it in no time. All what we tried went to hell he died - my unlucky dog.
