People from all over the world are immigrants to Israel and makes a lot of changes in our society.  The immigrant brings with them a new culture who effects on the Israeli culture.

It is not easy to come to a new place and to fit in to a place very different from the place you knew.  A lot of immigrants feel unwanted and feel different.

Also, it is not easy to make money, to raise children or do anything like a normal person because you donâ€™t always get the respect you are supposed to get from people.

I believe that all people are equal.  The immigrants should get a better treat from the country who welcomes them and I believe that Israel must each people how to welcome them in the nicest way.
