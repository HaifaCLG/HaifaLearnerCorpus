I never had any luck with anything that concerns lottery, gambling or things like that. I was never the wining type. Fro some reason luck was something I wanted the most. Of course, I tried everything from cards to those old machines with a handle on the side. On day while walking near those old machines I felt that its my lucky day. I put in two coins and felt the cold handle in my hand waiting to be pulled. I gazed in to the small wheels with fruits painted on them, will they disappoint me or not? I pulled the handle and the noise of the wheels turning, that I hated so much sounded so promising all of a sudden. Bingo. I closed my eyes  and laugh to the sound of the money rolling out of the machine. I changed the small coins to bills. It was a lot of money. I couldn't sleep at night. The next morning I went straight to the bank. But while I was passing a corner I felt a hard hit on my head. I fainted. When I regained consciousness, I realized I was robbed.
