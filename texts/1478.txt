The law in the developed countries doesn’t discriminate between the genders.


Unlike a century ago today the law in the developed countries (and partially in the developing countries) gives full rights to women. Woman can elect and be elected, therefore woman have the full power to influence on the decision makers. Legally an employer must not discriminate women. Women can drive, own property, gain high education, work at any geographic location, fly airplanes, and basically do everything men do. For conclusion gender inequality is illegal and forbidden in the developed countries.





How come than, that there is steel gender inequality in these countries? What are the reasons for it? Since the law is not the reason for it I’m drawn to the conclusion that it’s derived from social environment. I believe that this social environment is an outcome of a choice taken by both men and women. In a married couple the decision regarding who will it be to put more energy in his/her career, and who will it be to put more energy in taking care of the children is totally up to the couple! I believe that it is understandable why a company owner will economically prefer a person that decided to put emphasis on career rather than the person that decided to put emphasis on raising children. Now we need to ask ourselves whether the private decision of a married couple can be taken as gender inequality? I believe that women today have the power (political and social) to change anything they would like to change if only they would want to! Therefore, I don’t think that gender inequality today is a result of discrimination.
