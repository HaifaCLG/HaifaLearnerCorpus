Dear Lior,
Last birthday I got mounth of money from my parents. It really surprised my, I didn't expect to get this kind of peresent.
Of cours I give some of the money to my little sister and from that day I have been buing to all of my family member something special to theirs' birthdays.
I decided to keep a half of this money and don't spend it until I will have something realy important to do with it, I know that is my parents expect from my to do.
I allready have spend alot from it with you, my friend.
All the movies we go to see.
I hope you will have some idea for my on how to spend it, tell my what you think you had done with it.
see you soon...
