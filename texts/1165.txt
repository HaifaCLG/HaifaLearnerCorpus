Janet, can you pick up your sleeves?


Why?


Just pick up your sleeves!?!  Oh .... my god!  What the hell is that thing doing on your arm?


Ah ....... That drawing!  Isn’t it a beautiful angel/


I can’t believe that you did a tattoo!  I am shocked!


But M......M...


Don’t think that you will get out from this easily young lady.


But it’s not going to kill me.


Oh no, so I’m going to kill you!    I’m sure you did this because your new friends.  First you coming late home, your grade, now tattoo!  What next .... smoking cigarettes?


I am 16 years old and I think that I can decide what is best for me or what no!?!


I am your mother and as long as you live under my roof you will act to my rules.  Did I clear myself?


I don’t understand what about all the anger, why can’t you be like Dana’s parents they let her do whatever when wants, why does you have be so hard?


First, I don’t Dana’s mother.  Second, I have my ways to raise you, but regrettably it’s obvious that something confusion in my raise.


Don’t you know that tattoo can bring a cancer and this tattoo will stay at your arm for the rest of your life.  I just don’t understand what you think when you did that.


Mom you overact!


Maybe if I forbid from you meeting with your friends it might be the solution to all the problems.


Mom ... I want to tell you something ... chill down!?!


I need to chill down, you did the tattoo and I need to chill down.


Mom ...mom ... mom ...  It’s not a real tattoo just a label.


W...h...a...t!!!!

In my opinion:


It’s natural to fight with parents.


In the most of the time the parents’ right.  Because the more experience.  But I think the parents need to give us sometimes freedom and let us learn from our mistakes.


I enjoyed to wrote this because it show us that we need to think twice before we do something.
