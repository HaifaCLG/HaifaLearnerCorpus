Dear Ron
I am writing you because I want to tell you that I got a lot of money from my Birth day actually 20,000 shekels. I got it mostly from my cousing.
I will probably spend it on brand new computer with the most powerful hard's ware that exist in the market that probably will cost around 16,000 shekels and with the 4000 shekels lef I will buy xbox elite with few years internet account for it.
option 2 is: I will travel the world and see places.
option 3: I will buy a toy plane on a remote control.
I will probably chose option one becuase it is the funniest one!
