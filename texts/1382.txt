Some day a terrorist unit pass the border, and the soldier of the Israelâ€™s army found them and he reported that to the commander of the army.

They sent a patrol to find out what is going on and he found the Arabs on the way to some kibbutz, so they act very fast and the best they could and they killed the Arabs in the way of catching them, when they searched what the Arabs have the found a lot of weapons and from that they got the idea that the Arabs was going to kill people in Israel.

So after that they came back to the basis and wait for the next day that they hope there would not be another attack because every time they go after Arabs they could killed and not every time the all patrol come in one piece, there are sometimes soldiers from the Israeli army that they killed in such cases.
