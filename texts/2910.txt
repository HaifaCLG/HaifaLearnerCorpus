Before 7 years, my brother celebrated his bar mitzva. I was 7 years old. I really enjoyed it. We invited my father and mother's families and my brother's friends. My little brother was 3 years old. He bothered my parents when they spoke to the people.
In the morning of this day, my mother was really nervious and was taken to the hospital. But after 3 hours she was better and could come to the party.
