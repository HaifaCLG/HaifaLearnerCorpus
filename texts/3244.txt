(1) Every morning, I wake up at 6:30 clock. After I wake up, I go to eat and drink some tea, and I sit a little bit on computer, surfing in the internet.
After I eat I brush my teeth and go to dress up, and put makeup.
When I wake up, my father already in work and my going to work, and my sister, they drink tea too. I go out to school at 7:30 clock and at 7:40 I'm already in school.
(2) I see in the picture a mother, looking out of the window, and her chilfen eating. It is morning. On the table, there are, milk, bread, butter, and the children eating eggs.
The kitchen is big. I see a fridge and cupboards. I see plates and cups, picture, and fuits. There is a clock, too.
Before the breakfast, I think the children wake up and after it, they go to school, and they do it everyday.
