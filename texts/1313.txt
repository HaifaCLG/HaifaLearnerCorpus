In the table in front of my eyes is a special site. It is a table cloth with plates and things on it. There is also a vase with flowers in it. There is a saucer cup and plate.

Someone put on the table these things to make tea. There is food too. The food consists of apples and oranges and bread and a napkin. This is very inviting. The flowers and candle make the table smell special. The table is set to look inviting.
