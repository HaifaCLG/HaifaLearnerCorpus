A couple of weeks ago I dreamt a dream I was walking in a forest, I saw this mountain and I wanted to climb it. Suddenly many people jumped out of the bushes they wanted money knowing that I did not have any, and they smashed up my bike and did not let me go. So I wandered around looking for a way to escape. When I looked behind a bush I saw a little boy cooking soup in a barrel. There was an immense parsley in it and what I thought was a big potato, so I came closer to see it. I touched it when I noticed it was really a face of a person without any skin on. I ran away as fast as I could when my dream wake me up. A few days later I studied biology in the lab when I was looking at the stuffed animals I saw a fish that looked exactly like the cooked head with no skin.
