Finish taking all the Bagrut examination is a great feeling.

First, now I have time to do other things I can spend my time in listening to a music read books, watch TV and go out with my friends.

Second, I can organize a big party to celebrate the finish of the Bagrut examination.  I will invite my friends to my house, buy food and drinks, put a music and dance.

Moreover, I think my life will change after the Bagrut examination.  I won't have pressure do study for a test.  I can go out and get home when I want without thinking about examination.

Everyone who has finished taking all his Bagrut examination should celebrate it somehow.  It is a great feeling that will never come back and we need to enjoy it.
