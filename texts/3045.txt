Dear Alex,
I want to tell you about my birthday. At my birthday I get from my friend Michal 100 shekels. I think that she crazy because it's a lot of money, but I understand her because she is from my best friends like you. I didnt do nothing with the money yet but I want to buy MEITARIM of guitar because I want to start playing. In the rest of the money I'll not spend it but If I will need it i'll use it. What you would do with the money?
