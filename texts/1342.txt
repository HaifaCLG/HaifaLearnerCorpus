Good evening to all of you who came here and honoured me with presence.

As a parents in this modern time I’m glad you aware the problems in this “job”;  the fights, the late returns and I can move on all night, but I’m here to suggest solutions.

My first advice to you is to give your children more responsibility.  This will make them feel you are counting on them and will help you to build a strong and good relationship with your children.

The next advice is to support on them whatever they do or not do.  This will make them appreciate you, support you back and even share some secrets with you.

For conclusion I hope my advices will help you, even a little continue doing the hard “job” of being parents in the best way that you can.
