A very big black trunk that I never sew before. I run after her and then I saw that she went into a very big and dark church it was very interesting and I went in to too. Then I saw that she went in to a secret door to dark room I went into this room to and then I heard a very strong voice. I start to scared then I felt that something touched my face and I so a coffins I was very frightened and I couldn't moved my legs to ran away or to moved my lips to shut to help then I saw in the darkness the strong woman I saw that she stress in now a very big and black dress then I realized that she is a nun and this is a convent. and the room that I been in to is the room that they put them important nuns so I called to her and she asked  me what do you doing hear.
