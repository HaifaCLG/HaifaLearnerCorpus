Last year I took dancing lessons. I love dancing so I enjoyed it very much. It was twice a week. after few months we began practice for the show at the end of the year. It was hard but we had fun. We were waiting for the big night. When the big night arrived we were sure that we know the dance very good. And we are a good dancers. We were excited and nervous at that night to dance in front our parents and other guests. Finally we made a lot of mistakes we forgot parts of the dance. On one hand we were very disappointed because a lot of time we practice for this show and we were sure that we are the best. Both on the other hand it was very funny to see our dance with a lot of mistakes. And the end of the show my parents and my friends told me that its really funny that we work on this dance a lot of time and at the end we forgot parts of it.
