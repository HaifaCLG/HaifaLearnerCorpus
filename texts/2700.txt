In the last month we celebrated the sedeer. All my family members came to our house to celebrate the holiday together.
my mother and fatehr made delicious food, including baked chicken, potetoes, rise and a lot of salads.
my grandmother made traditional food like Gfilte fish which is delicious.
my uncles from tel aviv came to. we all had a lot of fun. but when we have read the "Hagada' suddenly our dog started to hardly barking and he disturbed all our family members,
but suprisely we understood the reason for his barks - he was the only family member who didn't eat from my mom's special food, so we gave him some bones and everybody had a lot of fun.
