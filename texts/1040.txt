Today when I seventeen years old, I'm looking back see that if I compared the army to the school. I prefer school. School was really fund. we had a friend from all ages and we could do whatever we want almost. But it could be better if the teacher would behave better that they did. For example when we had a free lesson in class it was cold, and outside it was pleasure and the principal wanted us to be in class and we couldn't even go to the toilet, I had to go to the toilet and he saw me and punished me, couldn't he understand that I'm a girl, and I had to go there. Why the teacher couldn't let us to do things without disturb, did they think that we, the children can be responsible in the tens grade. Are we small children, but I can say that generally I enjoyed school time.
