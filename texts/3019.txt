In the morning I eat piece of bread and glass of water, in the lunch I eat a big school's steak, and in the evening I eat another piece of bread and a glass of water.
At weekends, I eat much... everything.
I like eating frogs and snails, they are tasty.
I do not like eating Falafel, it isn't tasty.
