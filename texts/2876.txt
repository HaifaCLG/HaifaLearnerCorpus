In the morning I eat cookies, and Banana.
In the afternoon - I eat chikens, pasta, potatoes
In the evening I eat omlet, with vagtables.
I eat hamburgers, candies, kababs, and more... in celebrates
In the middle of the week I eat alone, in the final of the week I eat with my family.
The breakfast in afternoon - becase, this breakfast I give you energy to all the day.
I liked all the foods, because maybe my taste sense isn't good.
