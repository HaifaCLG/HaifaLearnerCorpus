The most interesting thing that ever happened to me was one year ago I'm went to the Kinneret with my parent's and my parent's friends too. there we go to hot springs to the Kinneret in the morning my parent's and I going to swim and to wind surfing in the Kinneret. I got up the wind surfing and I start to surfing I just arrived to the middle of the Kinneret and I look back my and I saw many fish. In many colors and the go after my all the time. I start to fear even the don't make anything this simple. Then I go deep to the fist and I told to my parent and my friends want happened my in the time I find surfing and I want to photograph them and see them again.
