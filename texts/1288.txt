In many schools today overcrowding in the classrooms had become a serious problem.  One solution offered is to split the classes into two shifts.

That way, the students will be able to learn more, and the teach could teach more.  The noise and the talking will be reduced.  The teachers' treatment would be much more personal to each student.  Even the school hours would be reduced (so the school would be able to fill two shifts).

On the other hand, how they would split the class in halfs?  The students wants to be with all their friends, that's one of the advantages in school.  Another problem is the economic problem.  Can every school afford himself so many teachers?  Because the teachers themselves will demand more money for extra hours.

In my opinion there is a lot of problems in learning in two shifts.  If until now it went great, why to change?!  I'll say if I survived 12 years this way, everyone can!
