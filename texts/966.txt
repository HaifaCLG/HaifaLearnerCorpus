I saw a movie he called flowers in the attic. It tells about the family with four children and parents the father worked out from the home and he came to visit the family ones a week. He loved his daughter the most and some day that the family wait the father came the chouse two people and told the mother that her husband killed, and it was a very sad days and then the family moved to the mother parents, but her parents don't talk with her and the moment they came to the house her mother took the children to the attic and lock the door and then the mother and the grandmother went down stairs and then the my grandmother hit with a weep, and with the time the children mother don't come to visit them and meanwhile they spend their time in the attic and the grandmother was poison the children and the young brother was dead and someday where the oldest brothers went downstairs they saw their mother spend with somebody and after that she gone married with him but the children say all the people the true and kill the mother and then they went.
