Hi Dasha,
yesterday in my birthday I get from my rich uncled abroad 500,000 shekels. I was shocked from this. I think what I will do with the money and think that of of this I will donate the money to sick children that need to this money and might die. In the rest I will save the money to my fuutre and give some to my parents because it importent to me to donate money and make happy some children.
What would you do with the money?
