I want to go to Hebron to support our country it Israeli.


No, I want to go home to Herzilya it’s not enough me the accident more demonstration on the head.


It’s your country to you should support he to and not matter what happened to you before.


I don’t want to support and on now just go home to Herzilya.


You don’t go anywhere you come with me to Hebron to demonstration * .


You want they take your country from us.


Ok, even the accident happened I come with you for the country.



What happened in the country it’s other nations want to conquer the Israeli country and we want she stay ours, because she small as it is.


My opinion is don’t return place in Israel because how much we give so they want more and this Israel don’t stay ours at all.
