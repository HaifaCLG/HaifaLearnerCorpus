Every day I eat in the morning (before that I start the school), In the noon (when I come from school). in the afternoon I eat a vegtabelse or a cake, and in the evining (before I go to sleep).
In the morning I usual eat a cake and drink tea or coffee. In the noon it's usually pastas or meal, and In the evining sometimes I ate eggs or correnflexs.
I'm trying every day to eat salat for my health, It sometimes happens in the evinings or nights.
In a regulars lunches I eat alone, or infront of the computer or a TV but in a wikends all the family eat togheter in a big table and the lunches is more bigger and unusual things that we don't eat everyday.
my favorite lunch is pasta that my father makes.
Things that I don't like to eat is tomato or cheese.
