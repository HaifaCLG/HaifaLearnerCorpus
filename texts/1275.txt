Increasingly phenomenon of overcrowding in our classroom has been existing in the schools.  The student get to 35-40 in each class and they all learn together for long hours.

That problem has found a solution.  Separating the class for two shifts, and half the class will be taught in the morning and the other half in the afternoon.

In my opinion this is a good suggestion because it has some advantages.  First, the teacher will control the whole class and teach them better than before.  Second, it help the students study concentrate with less disturbances and more attention from the teachers.  In addition the student will create more personal relations with the other students in the class and with their teacher.

In conclusion, this is a good idea can solve this problem of overcrowding in the classrooms in our schools.
