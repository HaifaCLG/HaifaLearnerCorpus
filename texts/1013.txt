Once, when I was a little boy, about 8 year old, I was wandering in my neighborhood. It was almost sunset when I started my walk, and afterwards the street became very dark. As I said before I were walking in the street, I looked at the old buildings and even whistled. I turned into a very long street and suddenly unbelievably I felt on my eyes the brightest light I ever saw. I was anxious to see what is the source for this light, but I had to cover my eyes because of the strong beam. Luckily the strong light vanished and when I opened my eyes I saw, yes when I opened my eyes I saw, I saw, I saw a space craft. A space craft is not an unusual thing for me I read about it, but I couldn't believe because this craft had a green door in spite of a blue one that should be. I was amused of the green door. I though before that space crafts have blue doors only. Well again this is a prove that you learn something every day.
