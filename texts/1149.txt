The relationship between my family and me is divided into groups like that:


With my father it's very well and the relationship between us it's across? To the relationship with my friends. We talk about all things, we laugh together, go to trips.


With my mother it's a little different, we are very angry one to another and fight about small things, but after all we love and care and want the good, my mother for me, and I for her.


I have 3 brothers and 2 sisters. With my sisters I manage very well and sometimes we fight about small things but it's not serious.


With my brothers it's difficult â€“ 2 of them are very little and I can't be with them because I lose patience. With my big brother he is 13 years old, we fight a lot but very close and care and especially love talk much, go to movies, helps in homework and in little words my relationship with him it's the best with my family, and the others very want to be close to us and to find out our secrets, but they can't and they give in.
