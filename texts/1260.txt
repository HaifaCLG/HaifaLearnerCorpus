Dear Students

In the last week the editor of the school’s newspaper asked us to express our opinion about the solution of splitting our classes to two shifts in order to take over the problem of over crowding in the school’s classrooms.  I wanted to show you how much I can destroy and how much I can help to you – the worried student.  In small classroom the student can concentrate harder and get higher grades as a result.  Also, the teacher can manage the class easily than managing a 70 pupils’ class and the most important thing in smaller classes that there is more quiet than in big ones.  In the other hand I found a few disadvantages of this matter.  For example, pupils want meet their friends if they learn in split classrooms pupils that will learn in the afternoon shift will be too tired till the evening.  Another thing is the costs of the bus rides – which would cost a lot of money.  Has that I made my point clear maybe you will change your opinion about this matter.  But the most important thing is to do the best for the good of the students.
