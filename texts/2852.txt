Mom and her children are eating Breakfast.
The mother makes the food, and the chidren eat it.
On the table: milk, choco, Bread, egg and some cerials.
There is a big Picture on the wall. It's a flowers Picture.
There is food on the fridge. There are dishes on three shelvs, on the wall.
I think that these kids are going to school after breakfast.
