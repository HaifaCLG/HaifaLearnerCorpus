Violence has become part of our childrenâ€™s life.  It already appears in the youngish children.  From my experience as a helper in a kindergarten, I face physical and verbal violence in 5 year old children.  This violence appears like biting and cursing against their friends, and sometimes even against the crew.  Recently, a said event was published in the newspaper, about a child in a kindergarten, who was brutally pushed by his friend, and the result of this was he needed medical care in a hospital, and finished his studies in a wheelchair.  I think that we all must take drastic steps in order to knock out this violence.
