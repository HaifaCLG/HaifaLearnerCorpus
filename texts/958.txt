I chose to write about the subject the most frightening thing that ever happened to me. My name is <NAME OMITTED>. It happened 2 weeks ago when I come back from a class party, the time was 3 o clock in the morning and it was dark outside. I walked along the street I was on my way to home. Suddenly I saw a man he was a tall man with a moustache and a dark hair, he looked to me strangely and I started to be a fright from him, so I cross the road but he came after me I felt more frightening and I started to shiver, I decided to run back to the house of my friend Uri that live near this place. After I run 5 meters I looked backward and I saw these man run after me, my color of my skin was white and I started to shouted help but no one was there and the man.
