The events on the picture are just from a regular day at school. The teacher in the bottom right side is yelling on a wild boy who got bored and made a mass of school. He broke the window and the teacher cought him ranging the shoes. the teacher thinks that that kid is the one who sprayed the graffity but this was the kid who hears music and plays innocent. The two boys who are playing basketball are probably using steroids because they are much bigger than the others. so this is my very unreal description for this school but still it makes sense to me.
