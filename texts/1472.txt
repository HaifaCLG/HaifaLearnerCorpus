When I was searching for a picture of my childhood I came across one picture that turn the clock back to this particular day when the picture was taken.The feeling was so strong that I could really feel the warmth of the sun on my face in that summer day back in 1978. The picture was of my three other sisters and me sitting in our parent’s yard. It was a real nice day in our summer vacation. Not hot as the other days, so we just couldn’t stay indoors. We were playing outside, enjoying the peaceful day. Running around and yelling, disturbing the neighbors. I remember a moment of confusion when one of the neighbors screamed for silent, and we run to hid our selves. We felt very naughty and we were pleased with our selves. We decided to play a quiet game so we choose Hide and Seek. We just finished playing, and we were laughing and breathing heavily and our faces were so red from our activity. Two of my sisters set on a big rock opposite with their back to each other laughing. The youngest just threw herself on the grass with her face to the sky. For me, I was standing behind, breathless, yet smiling, enjoying the moment. Suddenly out of nowhere my big brother came with his new camera. He focused the camera on our surprised smiling faces and the moment was frozen forever. I looked at the picture surprised at how much I remembered from that far day. When I closed my eyes I could even smell the same fragrance of that far summer and recognize the voices of our childhood. I felt as a child all over again, feeling free as a bird.
