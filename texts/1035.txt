Its was three years ago, when my friend Li do accident. before the accident we were good friends, we go to trips together we talk a lot and do every thing together. Li always was clever than me, she do all the tests better than me one day like in dream the accident opened, Li become a cripple from the accident she can't walk and she talk badly that I can't understand her words. When I met her the first time after the accident I was disappointing and frightening from her. Her looking was badly and she didn't talk she just look at me, I started to cry and Li started to cry too. I didn't know how to treat to her. So I smiled and said Li how the accident opened in that seconds her parents came and they say to me that Li must rest and sleep. I was glad because its was exactly when I didn't know what to say to Li. Li always like books so I gave to her two books, Li and I started to go far away and when I think about it it make me sad. I didn't know how to please her and why she annoyed about me.
