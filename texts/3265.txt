I think that this picture is about a suny day in the school, regular day in the week, that any one is doing his own bisness.
For example, one person is sitting and listenning to music, it is seen like he is really enjoed from it and singing to himself.
In the picture I can also see a little chilled that look sad and dissapointed from something he had done. This chilled mother is standing in front of him and it looks like she is telling him about how much she is angry with him.
On the gruss one person is sitting and playing the gitar, I think that this is some kind of hobby he like to do.
There is a few things that caught my attantion, like the broken window and a guss that very angry person decided to broke.
There is a graffity words on the wall that says "NUMBER 1 SCHOOL", I think that this graffity was wrotten by a kid that loves school very much and wants to show every one wath he think of it.
