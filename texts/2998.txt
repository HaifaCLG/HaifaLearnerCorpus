Dear Dan.
I am very happy to tell you that Makabi tel aviv won the final four and I won 10,000,000 dolars, lucky me! I have the money for only three weeks and I already bought so muce things. first I bought a sport car, a one of kind, there is only one in the whole world and its mine. I also bought a privte jat plane and a very big house (with a very big swimming pool!) for me and my family. I plane to give evrey year 10,000 $ for the unforchens and also give money for people in need every time i'll get to meet someone how needs my help.
I forgot to tell you I bought you and your family five cars, you will find them infronte of your house in a few days.
I couldn't help from wondring, what wouold you do if you had all this money?
