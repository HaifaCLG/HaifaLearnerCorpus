I was in a babysitter in the kitchen I was read a very interesting book if I remember it was New Hampshire hotel it was already 9 o clock the baby start crying. I went to him to stop the terrible noise and then it happened suddenly for a minute it was dark and a minute later the light come back after a five minutes it happened again and again and again I didn't  no what to do at the beginning I don't pay attention for this I thought that its a electric problem the baby stop crying and then a very terrible and very mystical music start playing from nowhere. I really don't no what happened I was freezing in my place when a space ship landed in the back yard with a pole of fire the door was open and from the ship get out a small creatures wearing a fold suit with a funny tie the start come to the house and then they disappear and I fell behind me that a very thing past everything not how he has to be I turned and saw a very funny animal with a lot of hair.
