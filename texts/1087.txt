I have a pedigree German Shepard that his color is brown and a little black on his face and back I trained him by my hand and he is good dog. He doesn't tied he walks in the yard but he can't get out because there is a fence but anyone except me and my family can't get into the house and the yard. He is one and two months year old, he is a beautiful dog and he love me very much. Some weeks ago I walked with him in a place without people because that I let him go without strap and he run and played with a big happy suddenly a big dog came and jumped on me then my dog came with a very fast running and jumped on the dog and bit him then the dog run away and I pet him, and when I came to the house I gave him a big piece of meat.

One time I and my family went to a trip and a place that was a army camp. And me and my brother play there with my dog then my mother call us to eat and my doge walk around suddenly he start to bark and me and my father run to see what happened and the we saw a snake that my dog bark at him then my father brought a big stick and the snake run away and I took my dog and put him and he jump of me start to lick me and I smiles.
