These days many patents are surrounding us, for example Microwave, DVD, computer, cellular phones, washing machines, video, TV, radio, printer, scanner and camera. We can see that gadgets are very important to us, it is hard to live without them, they are very helpful and make life easier.



Each day you can hear about a new patent that was created. Nowadays cellular phones are popular, its demands are growing up and it is taking over the world, we can see, and hear them everywhere. I can’t imagine my self living without cellular phone, it is helpful and important to me.


Cellular phones serve our purposes. They beep to remind us of our appointments and they store our mother’s number. In addition there is new gadget which is called PDA (Personal Data Assistant), it’s a cellular phone that is connected to net and can receive E-mails too.

So why do we use two gadgets when we can use just one unit (which is your cellular phone) to accomplish the same task?!

Well, this unit has advantages and disadvantages:


The advantages are that companies are looking today for wireless solutions, it will give mobiles business career, easy and reliable access to their corporate network so they can productive from anywhere at anytime others (companies) want to boost productivity, improve communications and make life easier.


The disadvantages are that some people say that it is suitable for kids to wing e-mails back and forth but its not suitable for stable business communication.
