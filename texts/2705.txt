I can't believe my good father gave me five hundred dollars for my bat mitsvah!
I really don't like having so much money, since I have nothing I need...
I could buy a lot of books, since I do like reading very much. Or I could get finally my own flute after such a long time I was learning how to play it, or I could just save the money so I could buy presents for the people I love.
My grandpa wouldn't like the last choise; he would surely want me to get something for my self.
Book I could always borrow from the library, and anyways I don't have any room left for more books.
So I will probably buy a flute, and then I will do my best to play him something he likes as a thank you.
