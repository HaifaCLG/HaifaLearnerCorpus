Hey Ron, I gained 10,000 dollars from my grand. And the realy is that I dont know what to buy with this money. there are alot of option and I will tell you some.
I can buy tiger, I love tigers.
I can buy new computer.
I can buy a car, more half a year I will become 18 age.
My mother says that I have to give half from this money to my uncle, he has kids and they dont have what to eat.
I think that I will choose to give half from this money to my uncle, because I think about his kids that they have much less cloths then me, much less food them ne. How come that I think about car when some one from my family doesn't has what to eat.
ok Ron, I know what I have to do with this money, I will give all this money to my uncle no half all!
