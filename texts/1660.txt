In my essay I am going to take about advantages and disadvantages of living in modern societies that consist of different ethnic.



On one hand, some people believe that living in modern societies is it a good thing due to three reasons: first, there will be quite problems between the people in different ethnic, these problems will pass to teasers or thorny problems.


Second, there will be racialism between the people; every religion wants to do all things and to take the part of the lion. Third, in different ethnic will be problems about presidential, every religion wants to be governor.


On the other hand, some people believe that living in modern societies is a good thing, due to three reasons: first, they persuaded that between different ethnic in modern societies will be sympathy and all the religion will be the same on everything.


Second, one religion will take and learn many thing and folklore the other religion to live in a good life. Third, they know that all the religion believe in one god.





I think that to live in modern societies of different ethnic isn't bad and inadmissible because all the people born in ninth months this fact prove that the all is equal and similar.
