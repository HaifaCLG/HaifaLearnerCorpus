As we all know overcrowding in the classroom is a problem we all supporting for.  The solution which has been suggested is that classes be split and taught in two shifts, half the class in the morning and the other half in the afternoon.

In my opinion the issue is very complicated.  There are both advantages and disadvantages.

On the one hand splitting the classes can be good idea.  In this way students wonâ€™t suffer from overcrowding, they will be more concentrate during the lesson and for students with different problems would be much easier.

On the other hand there are disadvantages to splitting a class means splitting best friends.  It means causing a damage the social relationship between students.

To sum up, even though there is more advantages to the solution which we suggested the disadvantages we need to decide what is more important to us and to other around us.
