Noam and Lior just attached by terrorists on their way to Hebron Lior wants to go home and Noam wants to continue.


I still want to go to Hebron.  A few terrorists will not stop me!


Leave me alone, I want to go back home you already saw what’s happened to us.


But if we will back home that’s exactly what they want and I’m not going to give it to them.


Who cares, my life is much important than Hebron, if something will happen to us, think about your family.


My family will understand me if I will die in Hebron they know how much it’s important to the country.


But the country is not important if many people like you will die for saving it.


I don’t care to die but, if many people like me will die always will stay people like you to live in the country.


It’s really not funny.  What we need this city if they always will be there and they are against the peace process so anyway they will kill us, then I think we should give it to them people life is much better than country.


Don’t you remember your grandfather that almost died in the war for this country.  Didn’t he teach you something?


He taught me to fight for my principles, and this was one of his but it’s not one of mine.


If there will be many people like you we never have a country.  I’m going to Hebron.


Goodbye and good luck.
