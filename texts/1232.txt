Go clean your room and after help your sister with her homework.  But mum I have to make my own homework and study to my biology test, I don’t have time for all those things.  But I need your help, I’m sorry mum, but I can’t.

An hour after, mum I’m going to my friend.

What do you mean, I thought you have now time?!!

I don’t have, I’m just doing a break.

So – where do you going?  Down.  Down where?

With Asi.

Again this boy – I don’t like him.  But I don’t agree that you will continue to meet him, even your teachers told that.

Mum, since when do you listen my teachers?!!  Look mum, this is my life, not yours!  I know Asi, and I and I think he is a bad person. He can turn you into a bad person too.

What do you know.
