I eat breakfast, which is usually a sandwich with cheese and vegtebles. I eat lunch, which is usually some kind of meat with potatos or rice. in dinner I usually eat eggs, vegtebles, cheese and bread.
sometimes I eat a snack in the afternoon, but that dosnt happen often.
in the weekend my family ghther together for a fesstive meal that we all eat together, even my buissy brothers, & then my my mother cookes a lot of dishes and salads.
my favorite meal is lunch, because I have no stress getting up earliy or going to sleep, but I think the most important meal is the breakfest becouse it gives you anergy for the rest of the day.
