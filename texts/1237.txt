I was 13 years old, weigh 50kg, a healthy and strong girl.  Well behaved and always smiling.

One day during watching a film Baywatch, a friend of my brother told me you can dream about her body, because you will never have like it.

That sentence was carved into my memory, and from this minute and on I hated my body and my self-esteem dropped.  I sat and thought, and finally decided to go on a diet, an easy one, but I didn’t know that it going to be very hard and dangerous.

Listen to my story, from this start to his end, and learn from my mistakes.

When I was younger- 13 years old I decided to go on a diet like I already said, I lost 10kg in this diet.  It was a serious diet.

I became pale and weak, I fainted and felt like a dead girl and also had dizziness,  I couldn’t concentrate at my studies and my marks dropped.  My mother started to panic, and took me to a doctor.  He gave me vitamins – a lot!!!  Until now I’m taking them.  My period stopped for a half year, and this worried me.  There was a time when I wanted to eat, but I couldn’t.  I could only eat a small amount of food, although I was very hungry.

I became very skinny, but I though I’m still fat, so I continued with it.

Then I got to a point that I almost couldn’t eat at all.  I ate an apple for a whole day.

I became very sick and everything made my ill.

At that time my asthma became worse and I was forced to use the inhaler 4-3 times a day, until I couldn’t live without it.  For 2 months my mother was with me, fed me and talked with me.  After those 2 months I started eating and stopped taking the medication so often.

I became stronger.

Until these days I can’t eat what I want and how much I want.

At that time I developed a few diseases and now I’m paying the price.
