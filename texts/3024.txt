When I was child my brother celebrated bar mitzva. He was very nervous for the event, he began to organise it two monath before it.
he wanted to made all ownself. He choose His close, the DJ, the place and even the food which would be on the event.
finaly He chose "Topaly" a pop music, the food which would be there, will me a "Maksicanic food".
However, in the event the music that was played, It was Rok music, my brother hated Rok music, therefor he wos very hangry because it.
in the end my father said to the DJ stop it and to play a pop muisic as whould be.
after it, the food that my broder ask for wasn't there in the right time, and my brother was exhasted.
finally the food made and everybody were happy, but my brother remember a bad event that he never had forgot.
