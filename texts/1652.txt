It's become normal and natural to see many societies at all the world that consist of different ethnic, religious and language groups so that because the vision of the other people has been changed and doesn't define according the person's ethnic, religious or language in most times, and because of that we can see that most modern societies are like that, it's never became Important for them the religious and language of other's.

But also that sometimes, there remain few problems of this consist of different ethnic and religious in societies about many different things at life.

At all, living in societies consist of different ethnic, religious and language groups has an advantages and disadvantages and it's belong how the society you live in think about life and the level of education in the same society.


Incidentally I want to begin with the advantages of these societies consist of different ethnic religious and language groups, so first I think that in this case of societies the domain against people to study and get new things at life from each other is more open because we are found in direct touch with other different people that can benefit them in which they know and we know in specific field in our life like to study new language and know new tourist places in the countries that other people came from.


Second, all society in the world have a private thing that they invent, so this thing may be requested in other societies, so in society consist of different people in religious and ethnic each society can give it's invention in order to get the others society one.


Third, in my opinion societies like that with a good relationships between the people in, is a clew and good example of a peaceful life and so happy full that there is an equality between them and never mind your birth and your color, but what's mind that what you can give and advise in order to improve the human life and do it more easy and effective because to take advantage of all minute that over from our life and live in a calm shiny world without wars on the component. But on the other hand there are disadvantages of these some societies, which in my opinion itâ€™s the contention of the ruling people and from which religious they are and about the rights of every group and what they can get and not, so all of there things are caused because of the ruling people, so in this case all we get is negative and occupy our expensive time and life in order to improve it to the better only because we are differ in religious ethnic and language.


Now, about to be better to live in a society composed at single ethnic group with one religion and one language it's may be better only from the social side that people accept others only from the same society, so in this case every one busy in his own life with not new things and important and only the social life may be calm without contention component.



At end, this chapter directed to every human one, and I ask, lets think seriously and really why we are continue with wars and contentions about ethnic, religious and languages, aren't we all human and we can live in peace and cooperation which make our life more interesting and happy without sadness, and tiredness, aren't we can?
