In the pictur I am seeing 2 people who are playing basketball. One people jumping and the ather wanted to catch the ball. They are looking happy and have fun. Near the school I am seeing a boy. He is looking lonely and offending. He is listening to music because he is wanting to calm down. and lower him's stress. (let off the steam).
Near the girls who reading books, I am seeing one girl. She is playing in the guitar.
