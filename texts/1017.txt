A strange think happened to me last night. I noticed that my cat acted in a very strange way; she began to scratch the wall with her head and then moved on scratching all of her body against every visible partly sharpened object in the room. At the beginning I thought that she had fleas, but after I examined her carefully, I saw that wasn't the cause. What I did discover were the remains of something brown and sticky. As I saw that I also noticed some very strange footsteps, that led from my room to the kitchen. I began tracing the footsteps to their origin. It didn't take me  a lot of time to notice the big, large, enormous stain on the floor, and even lesser time to smell the strong, sweet smell that stood in the air. A short investigation show that the stain was made of Coca Cola. The cat I held in my hand was looking a little ashamed, and made noised like rugs do. Anyway, it took me 2 hours to clean the stain of the floor, but what do I do with the cat. He keeps on sticking to things like table cloths, clothes and when it tries to run they fall with everything that was on them, usually dishes, by the way can you use wash a cat in a washing machine and put him in the dryer?
