I want to tell you about the problem that I think that every boy or girl in the teenager has problems with his family.


It tells you about me.


In my opinion I … old enough but my parents don't think like this so I have a lot of arguments with them.


Example: when I want get enjoy they decide to me a time for come home. I very preach? It in earnest? But they must trust me, don't you think like that?


Sometimes they ….  So annoying.


Maybe? The entire thing that I want is because I don't understand that I am not old enough to take the results of the freedom.


My mother all the time told me: Mali live the moment in the time you will and what you want to but you... still my baby.
