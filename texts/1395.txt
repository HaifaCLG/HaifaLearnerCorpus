If I had the opportunity to build the house of my dreams, I would have built it in a very quiet distanced location.  Maybe on a mountain high.

The house would be built from wood, and it would have a fire place.  The house would be very large, my bedroom would have a very large bed with satin sheets.  The house will be full of windows, that you can see from the beautiful view of trees and the snow in the winter.

Because I’m a spiritual girl, I’ll have lots of candles and flowers.  I’m not a material girl so I don’t want lost of furniture in my house.

Finally, I want that everyone that would be in my house  will feel relaxed and calm.  I think that my house will reflect my personality.
