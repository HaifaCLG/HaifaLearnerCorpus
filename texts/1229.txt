I want to go to Hebron right now.

I want to go home.

But we must go to Hebron, I want to save Hebron, and I want to be in demonstration.

My mother might hear about the terrorist attack in TV, and when she is going to hear about it she will be very very worried, and my mother is very very hysterical woman.

My mother is hysterical too, but we can call our mother that we are fine, I have a cellular phone.

You really don’t know my mother, she hysterical, in the phone.  She need to see me, and just then she will be not hysterical.

Stop it’s bullshit!  I know your mother, you are a chicken, you can run to your mother mummy’s boy.

You know what you can go to Hebron alone, and I can go home to my mummy.

I am sorry, but I feel that I must be there you know it’s our country and if we won’t be there to protect our country, who is going to?  I know that we have our soldiers, that protect our country, and save us from the terrorist.  But we must help them with our demonstration.  Do you think that just we be there, there is many of people from all the country who come special to save Hebron.

You know what you right, but I am very scared we had been through one terrorist attack, and we come out from it.  Thanks God.

I have idea I can go to Hebron alone and you can go home?

Please come with me home, I am sure that deep deep in your heart you are want to go home right now.

Ok I will come with you home but you must promise me that you will come with me next time ok?

I promise.
