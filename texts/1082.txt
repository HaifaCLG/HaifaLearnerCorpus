Too weeks ago I went to a party. A party to a person who will go to the army. In the party I saw a person very handsome boy who set alone with as sad face. I came to him and we start talk, I ask him why he said and he told me this story. Two weeks ago I was in a party he said and there I saw a beautiful girl, the most beautiful girl I ever seen. We start talk and in the end of the party I told her that I will take her to her house. At first she refused but after I take her to her house. She told me that from her she went to walk but I didn't let her. She felt cold and I gave her my army coat, the she near her house and then I went home. In the way I remember that I left my coat on the girl, and I thought that tomorrow I will come and take the coat. In the day after I came to her house I knocked on the door and an old lady opened it. I ask her if Sara is at home she told me that no Sara live her and  must be a mistake and she was going to close the door. I told her that I came her with Sara and its' no chance that she didn't lives here, I only want my coat. The lady, said that no Sara lives her but then I saw on the wall a picture of Sara, and I told her this is Sara. She told me that Sara died two years ago, and its can't be her. In the first I didn't believe but when she insist I start to believe and I don't know how can its be. Then he approach to me and said Do you believe me?
