The most exciting thing that ever happened to me:


It was when we were on a 5 day trip to Eilat on the summer of 1987. We came to the camp in the afternoon (about 5.30) after a walk trip in the desert we were very tired so we came to camp and fell asleep. We awoke at dawn and we did know what to do, we weren't tired because we slept for 6 hours, so we decided to go for a walk. We were sleeping on the beach a few miles from the center of Eilat so we had to hitchhike. We were 3 boys and the other 3 decided to keep sleeping.

We went to the road and stood there for 10 minutes and nobody stopped but after a few minutes 1 car stopped, she came from "Taba" they were 2 men in the 30's and they started asking us things. We answered them but not in a special interest. Suddenly they stopped in the side of the road, one of them got out of the car and went to pie the other started asking us more and more questions about where do we live and where do we sleep.


I told my friends that we better get out of the car, so we did that fast and told them that we want to stop here, we started running to the city and they started driving to the city and we never met againâ€¦
