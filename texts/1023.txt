Ten years ago, I lived in a big city. In Friday nights we all used to sit in our t.v. room and watch t.v. On day a party got started in our building and ws sure going to be a loud one, and it was Friday night. We all at headquarters got seated and thought. The answer was Death, and I was the one to do the job. So, I packed up my back pack my 38m my special sword with special days and times, and a pack of fire crackers. The target was flat 18. The time was 20.000 leaving time is 20.05. Time to get ready. I stood up and climbed the stirs to flat 20, planning a strategy. The noise was loud, too bad for the guys inside. The easy part was the door. I booby-trapped it, and rang the bell. One down. I got inside spreading fire crackers between the dancers. Passed through a bunch of music lovers and gotten with my gun. Took one out from my special bag and bombed the hill. I bet something like 12 down. I continued my way with my m-16 not mentioned above using the magazines and wasting at least 20 young boys and girls. Then I saw the DJ standing at the back of the room, making me mad. I threw my katana by that giving the people a ticket to hell and saw that DJ standing in front of me. I went a little closer to him and said, put it lower please.
