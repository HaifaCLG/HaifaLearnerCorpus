It was just an ordinary looking classroom table, but then, in order to help us practice description writing it changed!  A blue tablecloth decorated with fringes all around was put first, then without hesitation the teacher filled the table with items.  It started with a magnificent flower vase with white and yellow flowers that brought life to the table.  A conservative looking butter dish was put in front of it to the right just to be hidden behind a small plate with a piece of cutlery and a quite green tangerine.  You could notice its greenness because just to its left almost touching it there was a smaller but much more orange (and ready to be eaten) tangerine.  To its left stood a set of white and blue teacup and saucer with a teaspoon.  The apple to left of the cup and saucer was a bright green “grand” brand.  I could almost feel its sour delicious taste.  Talking about sour I wouldn’t want to try the tangerine with its dark green colour that stood in front of the apple to its left.  The milk jug behind that dark green tangerine was plain white medium size milk jug ready to be filled with milk.  Just between the milk jug and the flowers vase stood a beautiful candleholder decorated with colorful glass stones.  What can I say.  It will never look like just an ordinary classroom table to me anymore.

Thanks.
