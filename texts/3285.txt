I'm planning to go to a shopping and you have to go with me!
But in another side maybe I should to save for our trip to Eilat.
I think that I should to save the money for shopping, in Eilat, I think it would be best if I will save the money for shopping cause you know that the best shopping is in Eilat.
What would you do if you get money?
