Last week I was a bat mitzva of the daughter of my second ant. Before that event we prepeard alot, we shored, wore our Best clothes and brushed our teeth. At the event we mostly ate, becaue the food was realy good. They served meat, fish, salads and more. A funny thing that happend was my ant falling from the stairs. EveryBody laught and get there to help her.
to sum up, It was very fun and the food was good.
