I wake up at 6:45 in the morning washup, turn on some music, and then i start orgenizing my stuff for school all the books and all of that. I like eating in the morning, fruits or milk, but i have no time for it, so one option is waking up earlier but i'm too lazy for it, so i manage without breakfast just to add half and hour to my sleep, after getting dressed, i go out and get the bus to school in 7:15, sometimes, well most of the times i miss the bus and walk to school, but it's kind of relaxing to walk in the morning to school, my mom has practicly the sam scheduaile like mine and thats all about my morning.
