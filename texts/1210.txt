Hello, I home.

What did you do your face?  I hope you have a good excuse.

What do you want from me?  I didn’t do anything wrong.

You didn’t do anything wrong?!!  Piercing in eyebrow is nothing??!!  Let done the marks that you brought home.

So what if I want to do fun and about the marks you make to the teacher.

So you want that I listen to you?  Maybe if you was  more responsible to you move.

My move didn’t change so lot and I did become a bad person.  I just see the more freely.

Excuse me, but I won’t see my boy become a different person that do things that I not agree so I will do anything to get you back in earth and now you are going to start with something and how we to start to take off the earrings that you have on your face. Ok, ok, we do this in your way.

But I want you to know that I am really sorry about all this.

Don’t worry everything will be ok.
