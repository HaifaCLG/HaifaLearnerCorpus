Now, after I have finished all my Bagrut examinations I feel very happy.

The period of the Bagrut examinations is full with tense because there is a lot of material to study and the period between one test to another is very short.

After I will get all my Bagrut grades and leave the school.  I think my life will change.  When I’ll leave the school I will probably look for a work to earn money for my studies in the future.

The chances I’ll get a work are good because my grades are good and people prefer to take workers who have good grades.

After I have finally finished all my Bagrut examinations I should celebrate it, maybe my friends and I will have a party or will go to the beach.
