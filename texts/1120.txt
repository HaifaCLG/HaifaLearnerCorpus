On the January 29th my parents got married. It was a wonderful day for them that they celebrate every year. My mother was in the third month of her pregnancy with me. They were 18,5 years old when they got married. After 6 months, I came out from my mother's stomach! It was the great day that ever happened to me – but sometimes I think that it was a stupid thing to come out to this terrible world.


In the beginning I grew up in my grandfather and grandmother, when my mother learned in Bar Ilan, and my father was in the army. So I grew up, and grew up. We lived in town near my big family (cousins, grandfather and grandmother). My father had been worked with airplanes in the army, and mother took care of me. After 2 years my little brother came out to the world – another beautiful thing…


I passed my first 6 years in town. After 6 years we passed to Zur Natan for one year and then we passed to– my moshav today, I love it very much, but it's very hard for a teenager, to live in a little moshav like mine, because it very far away from any place … and in those days I love the city, the sea… freedom !!!


My parents made and make my life a great life, I love my family very much, and my family is very important to me…


I love life but sometimes I want to kill myself because I have a terrible day or a terrible feeling.


Today I am 15,5 years old, I have a boyfriend that loves me, and everything is great.
