Living in a society which consist of different ethnic, religious and language groups has its advantages and disadvantages.

First, I want to start with its’ advantages, which are plenty by the way.  The advantages in living this way can be expressed by exposing to different cultures and ways of living, to live normal and healthy life a person should make social relations, especially with his neighbours, so being from different ethnic groups could make it more interesting, and they will have a lot to talk about and important things to share about each other’s culture and folklore, people could only conclude from this situation and exposed to a lot of beneficial things and to feather ones next, which can help him in the future if he will visit different country if he has already information about, it could help him enjoy more in his time and avoid embarrassing misunderstandings as a result of not be versed in the language.

In one way, living in a society consist of different ethnic groups can be very beneficial, but in the other hand, it could cause a lot of troubles as a result of different ways of thinking and dealing with different situations, for example, a person who comes from a society which has strong relations between its’ members, and showing warm and love between them is very normal, another person who has a whole different mentality, consider this love infection as interference in his privacy which could lead to a very big problem.  Such problems could be avoided if people live in a single ethnic group with one religion and common mores, without any fear of being misunderstood or misjudged according to your manners or habits that you used to.  This type of society is a peaceful one, without any problems as a result of different cultures, but it is also a boring society, without any chance to learn something new or enrich your information.

I think that we can’t say which society is better environment for living, each society has its; advantages and disadvantages, the best way to deal with both situations is to accept a person as he is and don’t try to change him or to force your opinion on him, learn to consent different people with different ideas, don’t judge a person by his background or which ethnic group he belongs, no matter how different he is, see this difference in a positive way and learn from him because there is no other way.  Our world consist of millions of different ethnic groups, we have to live together, no one can live alone, even in a single ethnic group, so we have to be open-minded and civilised people to live in this varied ethnic groups world.
