I was walking with my family to the synagogue and we said special prayer for that New Year.

When we finished the prayer we went home and my mother set the table with all the special foods for the new year – apple with honey, pumpkin, pomegranate sheep’s head .

We ate a festive family meal, and sang song together.  In the end we all went to sleep.

The next day we got up and did it again. This is a time of year when we only do ritual things.
