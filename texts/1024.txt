Same years ago I was living in sunny. It was very beautiful place like orchard. The place was next to the sea in the desert with many palm trees. I loved that place and I was very attached to it. I left there after 6 years because a political resistance the Israeli government decided to give the place for a peace with the Arabs. The living there was very fun and I was going to sea all the time, I was diving and my brother is dive and was bring to us many fish to eat. We left in no time we had no other choice the government sent the police to clear as from there. Now I am living here. It is very beautiful place but I miss very much to Yamit and I'm sorry that I had to leave it I loved her.
