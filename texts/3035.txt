When I was 12 years old I flow with my perents to bat mitzva trip to France, Belgime, and Holand. I was very excited and neries because since I was little girl alwaly dreamt to be in Pariz and see the Ifel and my dream finely came true. At firrst I was afraid becaus I hate flying but when we get there it was so fun that I forgot the fear ant just had fun. We were in the Louver and the Grand Arce, and sew the Monaliza and the Ifel. But I had the most fan in the Dicneland.
