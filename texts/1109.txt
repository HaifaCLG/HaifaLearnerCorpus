I was sitting for hours, thinking and nothing. Anything possible came to my mind.
I thought I'm going to scream, I was angry about everything, but especially about that teacher – that gave me that order – to write a composition. It's the most terrible thing that ever happened to me. I could think of everything – about school, my friends, my parents, the test that will come in a few days, but I couldn't think about a normal subject to this composition – nothing. I couldn't concentrate, I couldn't set my mind. All my thoughts got mess.
Suddenly – I got an idea. It was like a flash that appeared. I was so glad. I started to write, full of join. My pan ran on the page, faster that ever, the words came out, got into sentences. When I took up the pan from the paper I could read….
This boring thing – this composition.
my best composition – I think – was the one about the dream that come true.
I think that my writing process reminded the same that it was at the beginning. Topics – easy. Vocabulary – easy and difficult – it depends. Spelling – difficult. Grammar – easy.
my writing isn't flow more easily.
writing in English is more difficult. In Hebrew I don't have to think how to write words, and I don't have problems with tenses.
