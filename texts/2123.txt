when I was 7 years old I liked to play with animals and don't hear my perents. One day whan we went to the zoo. I very liked the monkeys, liopards, foxes, but when we was near the cage with a parot, I started to enter fingers to the cage. One parot diden't liked thet and started to touche my fingers!
