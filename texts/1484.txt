I have learnt many points of view of different people from different countries. We don’t have an opportunity to interact with different people from different cultures everyday. I definitely think that it is a nice way to learn English through. Not only I had improved my writing skills but also I was exposed to different values of different people; however I think that there is one thing that need to be done in order to improve this course.

I was excited writing my essay simply because I knew that there are many people from all over the world who are going to read it; this fact motivated me to write the best I could. Furthermore, the fact that people who don’t know me are going to read my essay led me write a clear essay. For instance, when I wrote about the Israeli culture,  I needed to describe my arguments and give examples for each one because I had to assume that the readers haven’t been exposed to the Israeli culture. I remember that this (never assume what other people know) was the first thing Tina, our teacher, told us when she started talking about this online course.

I really enjoyed reading articles written by my peers; it was interesting to find out new points of view of people from Korea, Finland, Turkey. Each one of them contributed to my knowledge and left me with something to think about.

It was difficult for me to choose only three essays which I consider them to be the best because there were many excellent, fabulous essays. Moreover, I had difficulties in choosing a topic from the list because many of them weren’t suitable for everyone.

My recommendation for improving this course is that everyone can write about any topic he wants without limitations of the amount of the words. I would love to thank my teacher, Tina, who really gave us the tools we need in order to be able to write an essay. She helped me in every problem I had through this online course.
