The most interesting thing that ever happened to me was my French lesson. I decided to learn France because of few reasons, I learn language very fast, I always loved the French language which is the love language, I know that when I will become older I wont have time for learning so for one and a half year I want three times a week to the embassy and learned in a special way. We watch movies, heard tape conversation, read book and sing song. In the group there were many kind of people. All of them older than me. After a few weeks all of us became very good friends, and we made many parties and in the parties and all the other meetings we spoke only France. At the end of the last course every one make his own speech. I now days I am not leaning France anymore but I still like to remember those interesting hours.
