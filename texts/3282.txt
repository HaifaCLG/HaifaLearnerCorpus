Dear Yarden. hello to you my friend.
I got around 20 thousend shekels from my family for my 16th birthday I bought clothes, new computer and a motorcycle. About the rest of the money I think I'll give it to my parents they gave me so much more and they deserve it. For living with them so long.
What would you do Yarden if you were instead of me?
