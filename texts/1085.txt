My best friend called Limor she in my age and she learn in Talma Yelen She is in the dance class she very happy there. We are very close and we love the same thing we goes to movie together and going to trips together. In Succot we went to the Galil with tow more friend up took a big bag and sleeping bag and go from Rosh Pina to the Yarden and from the Yarden to the country. The trip was great its long to us two days of walking but in this trip was something very frighten in the night on the Yarden. They goes asleep very quick and I stay alone just me and the darkness and in not exactly 12.00 come a wolf on maybe just a big dog he came to the food. I makes very frighten noise I woke up Limor and she didn't now what I want from her and back to sleep. I didn't want to wake up the other so I get in the sleeping bag and fell sleep very fast. In the morning we saw foot steps in the ground and they were very happy that they were sleep Limor of course didn't remember that I woke her up her went home happy and very hungry and thirsty because we didn't took enough we I mean Limor and I goes to trip a lot of time to date and to the Negev maybe alone or with more friend. We Loves go on trips and how we planned its sometimes funny but we planned to fly to London Its more true to say to England and Scotland we have those plans and can imagine to arrive to Wales and more places like that alone of course maybe in the next big holiday.
