What a beautiful sight!  A vase with tiny yellow flowers is standing on the edge of the table.  In front of it there is the silver butter dish and candle holder which glows with its lovely red and orange colors, is next to it.

Next to it there is a little empty jug of milk and a fresh green apple near it.

On the left to the apple there is cup and saucer, and some fresh three tangerines are also spread on the right and the left of it.  The one on the left is lying on a pink napkin.  This beautiful arrangement is setting on a blue table cloth that has fringes all along.
