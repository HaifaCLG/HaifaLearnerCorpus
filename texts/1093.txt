I had a lovely dog. He was a Spanial dog his name was Suny. He was a very clever dog. When he was two years old he went with him to a competition and he was so lovely that he won in the competition. He was in some more competitions and he was the champion of his level. 4 years he was the champion of the country. After the 4 years of competitions we stopped to go with him to a competition and he was a simple dog. How play with my how go with my everywhere he slept with my he do everything with my. One day I walked with him to a small trip near my house he ate a poison and fall down. I didnâ€™t know what to do I kept him up and hold him with my hands to my house. My mother and I go to a vet and he saved his life last year he died when he was 14 years old I was very sad because he came down when I born and I grow with him now I get a new dog I think he going to live like Suny he going to be my friend.
