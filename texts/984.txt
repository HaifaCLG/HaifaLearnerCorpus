Its just an ordinary day, I go to school, nothing had gone wrong till the first 2 hours had gone by. The bell for the first recess rand. I stay in the classroom with some boy from my class. He talk me that some other boy had brought some explosives and they're going to blow it in the next recess, he says that they're looking for someone who had matches. We're spent some time talking about it till the bell rang. By the next recess we're got some matches and we went to blow it. we were about 7 boy, no girls. We're got some papers. Put it in the papers any lighten it up. All had ran and hidden behind trees but nothing had happened. we tried several times more to light it but it didn't blow up.
The recess had gone by. The bell for the next recess had rang now the kid who brought the explosive had some kind of a rope in his hand he say that fire run in it when you light it so we took it apart and took out of it just the explosive stuff in  it we're put it with all the other things soon lit it up. The stuff we're got out of the rope lit up and after a while we heard a little blow up noise. We got closer to it to see what was left out of it. I say to someone was next to me It's a pity that these was no big blow. and just as I finish my sentence Boom. What a blow I fell on the ground because of the blast. Nobody got hurt. We all ran into different directions. It was so frightening.
