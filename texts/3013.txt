Hello to you my dear fried!
Now as I'm writing to you this letter I am very exited!
I got something big to tell you so sit down and preparo yorself, so well that's how it's going...
I AM RICH!
No I'm not joking with you, and you asking probebly "how the hell" so the thing was like that, I found out that I have grandmother In England, she was the mother of my mother and my mother never told me about it becouse she wasn't in good conection with her and she tought that she died a long time agao, but here, two weeks ago I got a letter that brought to me by some handsome man woringa black suit, he explaind me the whol thing and that is the story, now I'm planning to go to England to my grandmother's house (and it's a big house) and start my study at there, I think it's sthe best thing to do because I heard the people there are really nice and the level of education is much better than here.
well I hope to see from you a letter soon, tell me what would you do if you find out something like that.
Hope to hear from you soon
youre friend
