Hi Sigal!
Yesterday I got 1500 sekel for my Birthday from my Uncel Aviva.
I was supriced and I say to her - "thankyou" and I gave to her a kiss.
After the birthday, I sat and thought what I can do with the many.
I was in dilema and I don't know what to decided - I think mybe to buy some cloth, or mybe a dog, or buy some magic...but I don't succes to decided.
today, I decided that I am giving the mony to "Vizo" for the cancer.
I hope that I help to the people who lie in the cancer.
Love,...
