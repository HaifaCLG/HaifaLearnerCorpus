Dear friend
How are you?
I want to tell you that my birthday party was gread and I was sorry to hear you couldnt come. Anyway after my birthday party I got big amount of money from my parents. To tell you the truth I haven't do anything with the money, but I still make plans for it. I may buy with it a video game for my TV or I might even invest it. that I will be able to earn more in the future, but after all, i think I will buy the video game because I love video game very much.
I am writing you because you are one of my good friends and I want to hear what would you do if you had such a big amount of money.
I will wate for your answer.
See you soon.
