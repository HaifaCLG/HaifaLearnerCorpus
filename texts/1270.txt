In my opinion the problem of overcrowding in classroom should not be solved by split the classes.  First, I think that the split of the classes will cause damage for the students what can not meet with their friends,  Second, I think that the split will cause damage for the schedule of the students.  Moreover, if student study all afternoon he will not be part of Bney Akiva or Hazoflm while his friend who studying in the morning will be part of it.

In conclusion I think that classes splitting is not possible.  So that we should another solution which that would not cause us damage for the student.
