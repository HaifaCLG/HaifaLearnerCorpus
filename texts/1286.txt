Did you hear about the new suggestion about over crowding in the classroom?  I heard and I don't agree with the idea because it is not fair that half of the student will learn in the afternoon.  The pupils that will learn in the morning will complain that they need to get up early from the bed, because they study in the morning and the pupils that will study in the afternoon will complain that they donâ€™t have time to a personal life because they study in the afternoon.  And who will decide the pupils that study in the morning and the pupils that study in the afternoon?  I think that it is better that will be a overcrowding in the class, instead split the class.  Or they will split the class, but the 2 classes will study in the morning.
