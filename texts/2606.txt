When I was five years old, I went to the "Nogdim farm". Nogdim means farmers. When i was there i learned the farming, the milking, the planting work and everything, and then when i learned how to milk a goat she sQuirter milk on me, and i got paniced and started to run all over the farm. It was very funny.
