There is a suggestion to split the classmates into two shifts.  One shift will be taught in the mornings, and the other in the afternoon.

This suggestion has many advantages and disadvantages.

One of those advantages is:  the classmates will have more time to do their homework and their arrangements.  The only disadvantage is:  the classmates won’t see each other, and won’t meet.  The connection between them will be lost.

In my opinion the only disadvantage the suggestion has, is the one that should most considerate because the friendship between the classmates make the character of the class.  If the decision harms the friendship, maybe the motivate of learning would be harmed too.
