School in the 21st century will be different. There will be more machines and computers. In my opinion there will be only a few teachers and a lot of computers. The principle will be a man but he will work with computers not with people. There will be smaller groups of students and more classes, but in a different level. Every student will have his one level and his one computer, not like now when every body and working together and there are few people that have 40% and have 95%.
In that school there will be no competition between the students so they could learn in peace with out the pressure. In that school there will be no books and notebooks. Every thing will be written on the screen. So the students could read and write from it. It will be match easy.
