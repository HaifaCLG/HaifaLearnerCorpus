It was late at night, I was walking alone in a peaceful park hit my home. I have just finished my work in my shop. It was a very bed day. nobody came to the shop and I didn't sold anything. I was waling along the trees and the flowers and thought about my boring life. I don't do anything with my life. Every day the same boring routine. I have reached a bench and decided to set down to look at the men who passing the park. I was sad, depressed and so bored the I didn't no what to do. Their were many people in the park in that time, all the peoples who finished their work goes to the park to rest and to enjoyed the beauty of the park. Their were all kinds of people in the park, families, old peoples children's, friends. It seemed very funny to look at them but it only made my more depressed then I was. until suddenly I saw an old man he was so strange that I couldn't stop looking at him. He was so dirty and he looked so poor. He was waling between the people and begged for some many. It was very strange but as I looked at him I felt better I looked at my self and told my that I have no reason to be depressed. I have friends I have family. I have food to eat, I suddenly understood that I have the important thing, I have my dignity.
