Hi Mor,
I am so so so excited, and I have to tell you that as a late present for my birthday (which was a huge success like I told you before) I have got a wonderful present - money, and a lot.
I know that you are dissapointed now, that you have probably expected to something interesting, beautiful, like a special book, or a painting painded by someone I love. But I don't have to tell you how much I need thing money, right?
to buy food, of cors, and clothes, shoes...
to go finally to my forgetable drawing lessons, back to the piano and guitar lessons, and my english lessons... If I had a box that the money inside of it would never been ended, I could study Arabic again, even french... Buy discs that I want, books that I like... Beautidul painting and photographs... I could buy so many thing, but it's looks too fantsy, 'too much'... Because I live really nice with what I have. So I try to think about things which I need and want. this time for real. I can, for example, pay for my grandfather's therapies, and relief my aunt from paing for this with the money which she doesn't have... I could travel to different countries, to take a good (and privet) doctor to my grandparents, buy some ghifts to my friends...
And I could keep the money, spend it for studding in the university, and for anything that I or my family/friends would need or want. Sad, but mooney can make some eries in my life more good, but "poor" life are more interesting - so, what's better?
