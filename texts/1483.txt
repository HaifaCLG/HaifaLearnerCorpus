Not once had the debate been raised about assisted suicide on our social agenda, and with that debate is raised the question about whether assisted suicide-should it be allowed or not? This is indeed a very controversial and problematic question which is a source of great debate. Not only in Israeli society, but also all over the world people are having trouble deciding and ruling over this emotive issue.

Those who are against assisted suicide claim that where religion is concerned there is a strict prohibition of taking life no matter what since "the lord had given and the lord shell take", in other words the lord is the one who gives life and therefore he is the only one who can take it away. No man is allowed to take life, not even is own life since it was given to him by the lord.

Those who reject also argue that if assisted suicide would be permitted, it would be very difficult to supervise and control the motive, and so it would be almost impossible to prevent interested family members who wish to get their hands on the poor dying man's money from accomplishing their wish of becoming rich.

Those who are for assisted suicide claim that one can force a dying man who suffers from a terminal illness with no hope of being cured to continue with this nightmare, and to stay connected to the life saving machines that only make his miserable life longer because what kind of life is that. No one wants to live like that and wait until the lord decides to liberate him from his miseries.





Moreover, it is extremely difficult and also heart breaking for the families to see their loved ones suffering and fading away in front of their very eyes. This situation is absolutely a nightmare for the caring families because who would want to witness the unending death of their most precious people. Sometimes things are so bad that the family can not remember the days previous to the illness when their loved one was still healthy and in good shape.
