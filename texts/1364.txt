Through the last decades the Israeli society had many immigrations.  Even before the 14th in November 1948, the day Israel received a legal rights to be called and independent country.

Israel had immigrations from all over the world, mostly from Europe, before and after World War II.  The immigrants of these days had difficulties with the Israeli society who lived here.  They had a different ideology.  So it was hard for them to get along.

Finally, immigrants has a hard time in our country even nowadays.  There are special organisations who help combining the immigrants in our society.  people in Israel are not making it easy for immigrants to combine.  I think we should be more thoughtful and patient to the ones who are different from us.  Itâ€™s hard enough for them to get used to a new language and habits.
