I eat breakfasts every day, lunch and dinner.
I never pass any meal.
I eat cheeses, vegtabels and all taips of food.
I like the lunch the most because our family eats at lunch meat and i like meat.
I also like to eat ice crem.
At the weekend we eat a heavy meals, not like all the days when we eat usuall meals.
