Many years ago was the school educating place where pupils learned how to behave with others what to say in different places and how to say it and the first thing we get there knowledge. At school we could have good examples at many subject. The relationship we create with the teachers were tight, warmth. The teachers were able to give there pupils everything they could when one pupils had difficult to understand something at the lesson the teacher was able to teach him at his home at the afternoon. Now the school change the relationships between teacher and pupils became very far. For a teacher a pupil become one of a numbers at his notebook. At this day there are a few teachers who behave really like a person you can tell him you problems your wishes even he is just your teacher who comes in order to give you knowledge. The system had change I can take for example a compositions lesson many years the pupils hadn't a composition lesson they had to learn by himself how to write and which way. But I don't thing it is better than once. I am sitting now and think what to write how I can complete a with page I need a lot of wards and O don't know from, where I can find them at the beginning it looked a very frightening page that i must full maybe I write bullshit but I am very mad about that system how you can make somebody do something he don't want to do. The subject you ask me to write is really boring I don't want you to be angry on me but that is really what I thing about the new system of now day.
