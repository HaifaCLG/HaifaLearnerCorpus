Lior, we can’t let this terrorist attach affect us, we must continue our trip


I don’t think so.  I don’t have the mood right now.


I think it’s because your father’s car was destroyed while we were eating in the restaurant.


Yes, but it’s part of the matter, the car is a total loss and I’m outraged.  Listen this is not the right time and right place to be in Hebron.  The matter is too complicated.


But we are healthy and we get out of danger so what’s the problem here???


You don’t have any feelings, people, another people who were harmed from the attach are in a bad situation, and you think about how to continue this plan!!!


I guess you’re right, but how can we help them?


I think because we were in the place we must and need to support in the harm people and demonstrate against terrorist actions and do something about it.  How much we can suffer, there is a limit out there.


You’re right.  If we do not do the maximum, let’s do the minimum that we can.


I’m happy that we agree, but first of all the most thing that I want to do is going home.  I’m too tired and frustrated.  I didn’t believe that thing would happen to me.  We need to convey this message to everyone.


If people think that they would not harm from terrorist action, they are wrong.


Terrorist attack can happen every place and to everyone.





Dear Hadley


Israel has a history with the Arabs.  Actually big history and fights all the years since the country was founded.


They fight most of all about the land.  So the terrorists who are Arabs with extremist opinions are demonstrating every time and apply their opinions/thought by actions.


The issue is more and very complicated than you ever think.  A letter won’t be satisfied and enough to explain the matter, but when we meet I’ll tell you everything.
