The beginning of this year we been told about a new teacher for English will come and teach us until the end of the year. I was very curious and waiting for the new teacher. Well, the big day have come and the teacher arrived to her first lesson with us. At first we made noise and we didn't liked her much, but gradually we began to like her very much and she like us very much. I personally got attached to her very much. The English lessons were my favorite. After 2,3, months she told us that this is our last lesson together, I was shocked I still am and I really hope that she will return to Israel one day so we could meet again.
