Two years ago I was present in my cousin's wedding - Adi, who married with Orly only two months from their first meeting.
I think that wedding got into the list of the most beautiful weddings I was present in. It wasn't about scenery or the bride's dress, It was about the love feeling that filled the air.
The most beautiful moment was the unique dance the new married capple danced.
that event completely change the way I thought about marrige.
