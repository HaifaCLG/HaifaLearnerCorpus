Bye Mum, I’m going to the mall with my friends.

Ok, when are you back?

I will back on 12:00 o’clock, ok?

No, I don’t allow you to back on this late of hour!

Why but all of my friends stay until that hour.

I don’t care what your friends doing.  I’m your mother and not theirs, and I will tell you what to do, beside that do you make your homework for tomorrow?

I don’t care, I’m going and that’s it!

Don’t be rude, I’m your mother not one of your friends, another from you and you grounded for all the weekend, beside it you don’t answer me about my question, do you do your homework for tomorrow?  And now answer me!

Ok, ok, I have some homework that I have to finish up, so?

So?  You need to be ashamed of yourself that you talk like that, and your friend, did they do their homework?

Yes, I think they did!

Ok, you will sit down now and you will do your homework, and just for remind you, you grounded for the all weekend!

That not fair!

Not fair?  You need to thank me that I ground you only to a week, someone else  was grounded his kid for a month!  And believe me I’m doing it for your good!

And Elad doing his homework without any choice and he learn his lesson, to do his homework!

I think that sometimes the parents of the child rights, but sometimes they punish more hard than need to punish, and sometime they don’t right.
