When discussing the issue of studying a foreign language we should consider the following factors:

It is worthwhile; if studying a foreign language is an advantage or not.

On the other hand it provides you with a lit of knowledge and culture of the specific language, and on the other hand, it involves difficulties such as spelling, express yourself according to norms of the specific society you are in.



As I mentioned earlier, there are a number of aspects that can be confusing:

First, when you learn a foreign language, sometime you may find it difficult because if you can’t speak the language fluently you can’t express yourself correctly so that other people will understand what you are saying.



Second, there is the grammar of the language. If you want to express yourself by writing and you don’t know that the rules of grammar are, there will be a lot of grammar mistakes which may lead to spelling mistakes also.





In addition, if a person wants to go abroad, for instance, Italy, if he doesn’t know the norms of the society and its culture what good it will do to him if he will know to speak fluently, one has to assess carefully his/her knowledge of his/her language before coming to a strange place and then when you sure without any doubt that you can write, speak and of course know all about your foreign language then you can allow yourself to overcome these difficulties.



In light of the fact mentioned above we can conclude that studying a foreign language can be sometimes a bit confusing and not always an easy task.



One can really overcome those difficulties I mentioned earlier by learning hard and do whatever he can to succeed in it because knowing a foreign language is always an asset one should cherish and so he needs to solve whatever problems he/she has with the language and if you set your mind to it I’m sure you will succeed.
