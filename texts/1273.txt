If I will finish all the English exams including the Bagrut exam I will feel amazing, because it's a good feeling to know you have finished it as you wanted.  It is really good to know you finished study subject who will be part of my life forever, no matter where I go.

Of course if I'll leave the test in a good feeling that I have succeed, better.

After exam I think I will go home and go to sleep after that long exam, and maybe at night I'll make a party and invite my friend to watch movies until sunrise or something.
