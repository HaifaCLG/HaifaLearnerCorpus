I can't believe I have finally finished taking all my Bagrut examinations.  I have been waiting for this moment for such a long time.  I feel such a relief to know that all the exams are behind.  All the period of the exams I was under pressure and I had to study all the time.  Now I feel free and I can do whatever I like.  To celebrate this terrific feeling I plan to do a long trip to USA so I could feel the freedom and so I could visit in this place which I always wanted and never had the chance.  After I finish my trip I will join the army.  After the army I want to study in Bar Ilan university, but I haven't decided yet what I want to learn.  I hope that by the time I finish my military service I will decide what I want to learn.
