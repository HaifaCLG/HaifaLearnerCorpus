my childhood experiences   is not a nice or pleasant experience .its happened when I was about 13 years old and I was at the 7th great in junior school.


At elementary school I had a lot of friend from my neighborhood and I was quite happy, but then I decided to go to a religious school the next year


Junior school.


It's happened to one of my biggest mistakes I done at that time.


All the girls there were already in groups and because I came from not a realigns school they use to say that I  am not like them that I am not realigns enough and gave me a hard time at the beginning


Then I kind of started not to care much about them I stopped to make any affords to be part off them, I really didn’t liked them at all and I didn’t had nothing in common with them I thought that they bunch of spoiled posh girls that I need to suffered for that year.


And indeed I cooped with it for that year and then I moved to another junior school and there I learned happily and successfully.
