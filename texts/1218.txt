I have 17 birthday on the next week.

Why?

What you mean when you say that?

Why do you think that I care?

Because I want to have a party in our home and I want to do a motorcycle lesson.

What?  You have lost your mind.  I am not going to pay for it.

So what you want to buy me for a birthday present?

You do not need anything right now.  When you going to be 18 years old I buy you nice car and pay for a driving lessons.

But I want a driving machine for now until I get to 18 years old.  It’s much cheaper for you.  I will not need to take a bus to school and return.  I don ‘t need you to drive me anywhere.

Motorcycle is the most dangerous machine on the road.  It’s a killer machine.

A car is also a dangerous machine.

But you will grow and you be more responsible and if you want you come to a party but not in my house.  You’re not going to bring your dirty friends to here and if you be happy I buy you a bicycle.

You can put your bicycle you where.
