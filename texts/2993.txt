In the pictur I see some pupils in school they maybe in break. They do some things like
play basketball
read books
play the guitar
listen to music
And som pupils just speak.
*The guys who play basketball look the older people in the pictur is even handsome.
*The boy and the girl who read in the book look like they don't speak, the girld sit far away from the boy, and the boy just read and don't look at her.
*One boy sit alone in the garden and play the guitar without sing.
*One teacher scream on small pupil maybe in grad 1 or -- he maybe does't make an HW.
