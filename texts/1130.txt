Well, I don't remember so many details because I was really young at the time.


I was about 7 years old and my gather making a buck at the time mostly by agriculture. He had a field which was in use for Melon and cucumbers, each at one part of the year.


The period I'm talking about is the cucumbers season, and I wanted to go with my father and help him. While we were on our way to the field, my father explained to me what we're gona do that day. When we got to the field my father opened and closed some water pipes. We got to work. I really had nothing to do that day. Anyhow, I waned to feel like I had helped. I got with my father on the tractor and my father was driving it. Suddenly I was falling from the wheel of the tractor to the ground, right in front of where the wheel was going. My father with all his instinct managed to stop the tractor.


I'm sure that he was more scared than me and boy was I scared. Somehow I managed to walk to the end of the field and shook to death and it was nothing like shaking from coldness, all my muscles? Move with strong shaking â€“ I was in that condition for about an hour or so.
