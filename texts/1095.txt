I have a cat. His name is Blacky. He is black. He is fat. When somebody opens the door he is entering and searching for food. Sometimes my sister is taking him inside, and he is jumping on the T.V. He fights with other cats and he often because his is a male cat. My sister saved his life. She saw him tied to a tree with rope. She wanted him and took him. He sleeps in our home all the time. One time he disappeared because he jumped over my aunt and my sister cried and she searched him. She didnâ€™t find him. Eventually they returned the cat. He is not an obedient cat. When he smells food he is jumping on the window and cries. Few time he tore our net in the window. My father always says that he want to take him away because he is disturbing him. He always beating him when he tear the net. But Blacky doesn't learn anything. He is not smart, but all the cats are not smart.
