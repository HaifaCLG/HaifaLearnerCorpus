Dear Lior
Yesterday it was my birthday. I've got alot of money from friends and family, and I decided to buy me couple of present's. I can save the money, or spent it Now! I just Don't know what to do. Some friends tell me to spent the money, but my father want me to save it for something good. But I like to spend money very much too. so ill probably spent it. because I can get really cools things.
Ill buy clothes wii, xbox 960, new computer, I pod 80 giga and a new cell phone!. that will be alot more fun. well, I really want to spend it. see you later
your friend
