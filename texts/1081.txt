My Siamese cat had a terrible accident, she had to have an operation. After two day she died. It took us about a month to get over it. Some friends of ours called and asked whether we would like to take care of a white, long haired Persian cat they didn't mention the state which she was in. We went there to our friend's house. The lady of the house was the one who loved pets, she said that taking care of that cat is too much for her, cause she already had 5 kittens and a dog and the new cat which has been given to her from a non pet lover family. They gave it cause they bought new furniture. I don't like those kind of people. When I tried to take the cat into my hands she scratched me and my hands got covered with blood, so I got some gloves, taken the cat put it into a basket closed it and took it home. Only about 4 months later she eased down and we could pet her. She was so white we called her snow.
