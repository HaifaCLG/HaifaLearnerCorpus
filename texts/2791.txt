Hey guys I'm going to tell you about my uncle bar Mizva. it was 19:00 and we drove to Kala hall. in the event I always went out and came back, because every one was looking on me every time thet I did it and it was fun. All my family was in this event. my uncle father ran this event, there was happy music. The food was great, there was meat and kula.
When I went out in my 27th time I fall and every one was joking on me. I didn't mind it I just stopped to go out and come back
