Saturday Meal
Last week, At Satruday I and my family went to my grandma. All my cousins came to the meal.
It's not a regiluar meal It's realy speical meal
My grandma prepred all the food.
At Satruday we don't play music because It's againsts the Bible. We ate a lot of food. We ate salad, mean, furit.
My grandma tried to prepre new salad.
We tasted the salad and It is vary not "delicious".
Every one don't like the salad. I give to my mother to taste the salad and all the family laugh.
