I86


In the evening of new year, I went to the synagogue to pray.  After the pray all the family was in my uncle house and ate the main meal.  We ate the regular things but my family also have some special food:  couscous, harayme, mafrum, basin.  We also eat this food in Shabbat except basin.  We eat basin only in new year.  Basin is something we like to eat because it is sweet and will make the year a sweet one. Also synagogue we have a big exciting when we hear the shofar.

Our holiday was in Jerusalem and we go to the west wall and pray there.  It was a great holiday!!!
