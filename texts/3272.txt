I'll describe my bar Mizva, I'll never forget this day, I remembe how I felt, so speical, all my family and my friend was in a beg hell, and there was some people that I didnt know who they are, but this is nice that they came for me.
The DJ invited me to the stage and standed front 200 people.
I should read the 'drasha' and after I done the party was begining.
