When I was in Russia, me and my famioly went to trip in Socha. It always cold in Russia and it almost doesn't have summer. Socha is a place where is a san and beach. It took a few days to get there and we went there with friend. It was very fun. me and my brother were very young - I was 3 years old and my brother 5 years old.
As childhood expirience it was very fun and beauitiful, I wish sometime I'll be there again.
