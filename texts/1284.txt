Some people believe that the overcrowding in the classrooms is a bad thing and so they want to split the class.  Other people object to this opinion and want the situation to stay as it is right now.  There are two sides to everything, and here are some arguments on each side.

If there is going to be a smaller class the pupils can learn in a higher level and also faster that they are learning now.  Also, if the class will split then students would be able to choose whether would like to take a class in the morning or in the evening.

But on the other hand when a class is very small the pupils can't get to know many friend which is a special and important element of school.

For conclusion, there are all kind of opinions about whether to split the classroom or not.  I believe that this situation should stay as it is now.
