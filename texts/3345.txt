Dear Joe!
How are you/ Thanks for sending a birthday card to me. It was hilarious. I wanted to tell you that for my birthday I got a huge amount of money! 7000 dollars to be spending. I bought myself a new car because I'm close to get my Driving permit!
It's a fiat 1003, a very nice car for a start at first I wander to go on a trip to New Ziland or something like that, but I was thinking about the weekendsin wich I would have to fight on the car with my parents then I decided to buy my own car. What do you say? What you would have done with the money.
