I was interested in my peers' personal introductions. To see what they love to do, their hobbies and life styles. It was an interesting experience to talk to people from other coulters, and different countries. I had the chance to have a glimpse of what other thinks about different topics throw their articles. There was a verity of topics to write on; therefore I had the chance to read articles on all kinds of topics. I was surprised to see how each one differs from the other in the way he thinks, and express his thoughts in writing. The part I liked the most was to read what others wrote to me regarding my introduction, it mad me realized that I have something in common with each one of them, which was nice to know.


I really enjoyed this few weeks in the discuss it form. I had a chance to free write in English which was good. At the beginning I was actually a bit scared that I won't mange to write so many words as we were instructed to, but I did mange after all. I also didnâ€™t think that I could choose one topic that I can relate to and write an interesting assay on. I feel as if I made some progress with my English although it was for a short period of time. It was the first time that I participated in an international form, and the first time to be exposed to all kinds of writing styles.


I believe that the form was handled very well, and it was more than clear to me. In addition to that it was easy to follow and work with. The tasks were understandable, and varied. For me it was a good practice to participate in this form, I would love to join this kind of activity again.
