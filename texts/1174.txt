Hi, my name is Hadley and I now can you tell me what happening here?


Yes, the Israelis and Syrians to convince about Golan.


Really, but to who belong Golan first?


Golan was belong to Syrians but we conquer in the Six Day War.


So Golan need to belong to Israel so why the Syrians want Golan back if the Israelis conquer Golan.
