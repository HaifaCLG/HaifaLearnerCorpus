Our life makes us feeling happy, sad, nervous, angry and satisfied.  Many people think that we can’t control our feeling because our life is not controlled by us.  God is managing our life without asking us what we want to happen.  I believe in another way.  I believe that we can control our feelings.  We can make ourselves feeling happy and satisfied more than we think.  One of the things in suggesting for adults, is to go to the beach and watch the waves moving and getting closer and closer to the shore.  It’s a very relaxing thing to do after a hard and stressful day of work.

Another way to feel calm and comfortable at work like you feel at home, is to put pictures of your family on your desk or jut in the office.  People are feeling relaxed when they are near their family so this is a good way to help ourselves keep our good feelings.

I really hope that people all over the world, especially the adults, could enjoy their life more than they think they do, because if you are feeling good calm and relaxed you will take things easier and always remember that the most important thing in our life is our feeling.
