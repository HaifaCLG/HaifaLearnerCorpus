Places in the world are different in many ways. They differ in language in many cases; they differ in culture, in geography and of course in climate. Usually, areas around the same latitude on the globe are very much alike in terms of weather. That explains the similarity between California and Israel; even though they are very distant from one another, the weather conditions are the same. The small distance between Israel and England, however, makes a lot of difference in terms of weather because they are located on different latitudes.

The winter for example, is characterized in Tel Aviv with few days of torrential rain (that sometimes causes floods), few days of sunny-rainy days, and many chilly-sunny days. The winter in London, however, is very hard. It is characterized with continuous and sudden torrential rains; the skies are gray all the time, it is much colder and very long.

Another example is the length of the seasons. The summer in London is very short- about two months long, while the summer in Tel Aviv is very long- about six months. Accordingly, the winter in London is approximately eight months, while the winter in Tel Aviv is approximately four months.

Even though London and Tel Aviv are so different in climate there are still few similarities. It occurs in London that an extremely hot humid day arrives, just like one of the Tel Aviv summer days. And the winter in Tel Aviv is generally comparable to some of the autumn days in London.

It is hard not to notice the dissimilarity between the two cities when it comes to climate. The similarities are undoubtedly rare. If we desire to find more in common we should find another field of comparison but the whether.
