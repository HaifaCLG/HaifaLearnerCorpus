There's a table that is covered with a blue nice table cloth on this table there are different kinds of items and fruits.  There's a silver vase that contains real nice flowers.  In front of this vase we have a unique candle holder with a tiny white candle in it, next to the candle holder to the left side there's a silver butter dish and at the right side there's a tiny white milk jug.  In front of the milk jug lays two kinds of fruit one is a deep green tangerines and next to it to the left an apple next to the left side of the apple we can see a decorated cup and saucer with a silver teaspoon next to the cup and saucer we have a white plate which lays on it a pink napkin, a green tangerine and a silver knife between these two items the cup and saucer and the plate we have another green-yellow tangerine.
