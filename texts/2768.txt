In the picture we can see a kitchen. In the kitchen we see two kids, a boy and a girl, eating there breakfeast while there mom is looking outside the window. There is bread and cereal on the table as well as milk, there is a picture of a vase on the kitchen wall. there is a clock above the window the boy's mother is looking. There is an oven and a dish washer in the kitchen. I think that after the breakfeast is over, the kids go to school and after the school is over thy go to meet friends.
