The study of a foreign language is difficult because it depends on learning both strange words and a different culture in which that language is spoken.

Each language is opening a new world of studying the country, the people, the culture, the tradition and the history.


There are few aspects of learning a foreign language that I find particularly confusing first, in each language there are so many words and phrases that people are using on a daily bases or what is written in books which will be difficult for a person who is "outsider" (not learning in that particular state where the language is spoken) and for that the aspect of knowing the language perfect and control all the vocabulary is extremely difficult for me to overcome.

Secondly, there are many language that what you read from a paper that isn't how you are expect and need to say and read the world or the text for example: Fran?ois is a perfect example of a language which the people don't say the world like it's written but they know which part of the word you need to say and which part of the word you mustn't say.



Another aspect of learning a foreign language that I find particularly confusing is the accent, there are many language like: French, Italian Spanish, Portuguese which you should know the accent because of the simple fact that if you won't have the accent people simply won't understand you because the accent in that particular language takes a big role in terms of people to understand you and I, for example, think that the issue of the accent can be a road black for me. But like any new thing that you learn in life which is difficult you can to overcome in many different ways.



First of all, on the issue of lack in reach vocabulary you can overcome in a few ways like: you can read more books in the particular language that you feel that your knowledge in word is limited and by that you won't only learn a knew words but you should earn new things in that book that may open spaces for you in learning a new things, in addition you can watch in the TV channels that is translated from a foreign country and from that you would learn a new word and you would hare a glimpse on there daily series and opera's which the foreign people is waiting, and, of course, the internet the allowed you to serve to far places in the world and to talk with foreign people from all around the globe.



Secondly, on the topic of finding a difficulties on how to say the word correctly, you will learn how to do it with the time because when you are learning a language there are roles of how to say the particular word of words that you must obey and in the long way, if you will be determinate and sit and learn by hard the sounds of the word you will succeed.





And the last difficult on the issue of the accent you can solve that too by training and by matching your mouth and your sound to the needed accent, for example if in some language you need to talk with a low ton of sound voice, so you will match you mouth to this sound's and by the time you will learn how to pronouns this accent.

For conclusion, there are many different difficulties in learning a foreign language but if you are willing to sit and to invest all that you can in that I promises you that you won't failed and you will know the language successfully.
