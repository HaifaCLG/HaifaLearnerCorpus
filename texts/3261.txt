Dear tamat

I bought very nice shirt (50$), shoes (2100$) and 5 books - one of them is new moon thet I wanted to my 14 birthday.
all this books cost me 300$.
and i bought alot of rins and present to my femely. I think that all my money that i didnt west I gave to a children house. children with no hous and no femily. and if I still have money i will buy a new leptop or mp4 the broken last month.
