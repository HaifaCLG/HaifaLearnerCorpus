Only her best friend knew about it, she told her once that she's in love with him, his name was Lior. He was a boy from the other class, she was very shy and she hardly dares to speak to him.


One day her friend her friend told her: "I'll talk with him about you, will see what we can do, o.k.?" "Well, I don't really know" she answers, "Oh, don't worry, it will be ok" She said, "So call me, will you?" Oh, of course I will, she said.


Well that afternoon she did call, she told her a story that she didn't talk with him yet, maybe tomorrow, but she felt that it wasn't the truth, and the thought that he told her he doesn't love her, or even like her, so she said nothing so that she won't be hurt. She was very depressed and she got inside her room and didn't want to get out, her mother felt something have happened but she said nothing she just ask her whether she want to go to movie, to get out of her depression, she didn't want to go but her mother convinced her to. They got inside the movie she saw him!!! for one moment she was the happiest girl on earth but a moment after, she saw a girl who looked familiar, it was no other than her best friend â€¦
