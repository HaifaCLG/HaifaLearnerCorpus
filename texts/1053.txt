One day my son came home and told me that its no good to work with computers and he explained me what happened and what are his problems. he told me that to work with a teacher computer its not like a human teacher, and he said that he don't like it because the computer gives him always tests and he don't say to him that his homework are bad or good or if the way he works is good or bad, so I told him that when I was at tenth grade we thought that it would be better with computers teacher and not with a human teacher because the teachers were too rough and they gave us punishment and we didn't like them.
