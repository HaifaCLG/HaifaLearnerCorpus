At home I have a lot of animals, parrots, dogs, squirrels cats and others. My favorite parrot is Gandi. He is a African parrot and he is belong to me. I got him about two years ago from a very successful raiser. The parent left him and didn't take care of him, so he didn't eat for a few days and that why he calls Gandi. When I got him he was a few months old and still could not eat seeds, so I fed him with baby food by a few spoons. After a while he started eat seeds and fruit too.  When he was about six months old he started talking. Now he talks very nicely, he can say more words than most parrots. I like him a lot and supposed he likes me too.
