When I was a young boy like 8 years old. The relationship with my family was very good but is still like that.  We were very enjoyed. We went to trip withy my father friend. Every year we went to another hotel. It's continue until today – all hotel is in another city. We enjoy the hotel and we speak a lot one with each other.


Once I met a nice girl and we spent a lot of time together. I like to tell my parents about everything that happened to me, and one of the story was:


I was walking along the street and I met a famous player football. His name is Moshe Sinai – he played in Maccabi Tel-Aviv group. I began to talk with him and he invited me to his house. I went to there he has a beautiful house and children. He lived in North Tel-Aviv. I talk with him about all the things, about his group, and about his life. After it I left him with a good feeling.


When I told it to my father he said that he wants too (to meet him). I phoned to Moshe Sinai and he agreed to meet my father. My father was very enjoy to meet him.


This is the relationship with my father. I told him everything that happened to me. It's a good relationship.
