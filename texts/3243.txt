Hi.
As you know, I celebrated my birthday last week and I have given 1000 shekels to the birthday from my parents. I was so happy!
I think I finally will buy the books, I wanted to buy. I have just spend 300 shekels on some makeup I needed until now. I think that I will do a new haircut with this money too. I hate my haircut!
But I won't spend all the money. I want to collect itto buy some new clothes. What do you think I should buy with this money? What would you buy with this money? I cant wait to recieve your answer!
Yors...
