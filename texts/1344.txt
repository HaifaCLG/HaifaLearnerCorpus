Welcome, parents, today’s lecture.  I’m your speaker, and today we will talk about your children’s reading habits.  As you probably know already, the kids of today aren’t very interested in reading books.  They probably even try to avoid reading them.  And why shouldn’t they?  They have TV, computer games and many more.  Books are placed last in their list of “fun things” they can do (well, most of the children think so, I suppose).

When and how did the children learn that books are “not fun”?  Well, do you remember when they were young and still learning about life?  Most of the parents stopped reading for their children when they learned how to read, and that’s when the lack of book reading begins.  Without your guides, they wouldn’t read to themselves much longer.  You shouldn’t stop reading for them!  They’ll love reading with you bedtime stories.

Another issue to be talked about is the children’s opinion about reading books.  As kids, they learned (probably from there parents that reading equals boring.  Why is that?  Try to remember when you younger, you had some kind of image of certain world.  When you were hungry – you ate.  When you were tired – you go to bed.  And what did you do when you got bored?  Asked your parents for advice and what did they tell you?  “Go and read some books”.  That’s the problem!  Children of today think books are boring, because they are “naturally” linked to bore!

Well, parents now that you had the main sources of the book’s bore level problem, you ought to do something about it.  Try to read with them again, make sure they know how interesting books are and show them that when the electricity goes out  there’s all something fun to do!  Right!!!
