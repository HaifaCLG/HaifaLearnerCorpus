Few day ago, I was at a wedding.
It was so beatiful, The bride wore a big white dress that sparkle.
At the begining, The guests were outside. I was eating when sudenley I heard this beatiful song.
The bride and her husbend came in. I was so emotional, I cried.
After the ceramony we com into the building and danced.
In the midlle fo it, The bride sudenley faited for a second, It was very funney actualy, becaus it happend when she danced on the stage.
After the party, I kissed the brid (I love her) and went home. When I will get married, I want my wedding to be just like that.
