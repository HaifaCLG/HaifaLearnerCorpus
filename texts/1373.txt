Mummy, you know, all the time thinking what I will be when I will grow up.

When I was in your age I wanted to be a pilot but in the time I realised that I can’t be in that work because first:  now a lot of pilot second to be good pilot you have to by first in air force and there can go just man not woman and third I heard from a lot of friend that were there and from my cousin that wanted to be a pilot and make a lot of thing to get there like fitness high and he study good and have a high remarks and he know about the air force a lot and all of them told my that to get there air force you must to be the best in fitness and in intelligence and a lot of grades because if you are accepted to the course that continue 2-3 years you can study every day and if you doing all the work in the end you have the last hard examination and this is check your power of endurance in this you like a prisoner and they do you a lot of torture and asking you what your name any things on the security of our country and they want to see if you will answer them and if you pass in that exam you like a pilot and then they just make you really pilot.  So I decided that I do want to by pilot because it’s too hard for my but when my time to get the army was coming there was ability for woman to be a pilot too and so I when to the army and have made all if him and had a good and this was very hard.  There I went you father.  We was in the same army.  Later I left the army and started to work in  company like I always dream and this it the best of life  because when you want to do something and you made it you think that you can do anything and I this feeling.  You can continue to solve problems in life and everything.

Mummy, I want to be an astronaut.
