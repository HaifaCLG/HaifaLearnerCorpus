I have a good relationship with my family. When I wake up in the morning at 4.30 I start my job as a member of my family. First, I wash up the dishes, and when I see that one of the dishes has dust on it I become full of joy and I clean it at once. Then I go to my room and clean it.


After these jobs, I take a bucket, fill it with water and wash the floor of the house – all the floor we have. Then, I wake up my mother by telling her:" Good morning, good morning my dear mother, I love you". I wake up my father by telling "Good morning, good morning, and my dear papa".


When they get up they tell me "Oh, dear son, l love you, thank you for waking me, thank you, thank you, thank you".


Then I go to school – I arrive back to home and make my homework as soon as I get in, then I tell my mother: "Dear mommy, you go to sleep, I will make for you the finest dish you ever tasted". Then I make fine dish with the most delicious ingredients. While I and my mother are eating, I tell her how fun it was in school, she tells me what wonderful son I am. At this point I usually blush and tell my mother not is over excited.


When we finish our meal, she places a big kiss over my forehead. Then I go to sleep my afternoon sleep, ready to be recharged for another brand new day of fun and joy in our house.
