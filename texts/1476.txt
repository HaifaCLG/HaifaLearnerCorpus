I think children and adolescence impact media in a way that they can increase and decrease the rating of the programs that are being broadcasted. That is how they influence the media. I also think media should dedicate programming to difficult and real life issues because, that way children and adolescence become more aware of things that are going on around them. It may increase their tolerance to other people as well. In addition, I tend to believe that the media should stay away from images that are too violent and sexual because children and adolescent are very influenced by the media, especially at these ages. Therefore, they may become violent towards their peers, their family and even themselves. They may also try and imitate sexual characters as well as sexual behavior. All that may lead them to start having sexual intercourse at a very early age. That is why I believe that exposing children and adolescence to these images is very harmful and by doing that, the media teaches bad habits. Here is where the parents come in. they have to set a good example for their children by teaching them what is right and wrong and to set them rules as well.
