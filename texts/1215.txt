Like rest of the families we cleaned our house very good.

In new year eve we put a lot of food on our table, like pomegranate, honey with apple, head of fish and the rest of food that belong to the holiday.

After we put everything on the table we sat and my father start to pray the prayer of new year and my little brothers (twins) join him.

When they finish my mother and my big sister bring the food.

It was a lovely evening, we laughed, and have a good time.

After we finished to eat, everyone start to help to clean.

I was the dishes and brothers life the things from the table.

Well, that what happened in my home, not something special.

PS:  Have a good succot holiday, I hope that you have a great time.

Good bye!!!
