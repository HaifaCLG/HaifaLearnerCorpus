I wasn't expecting any presents, to be honest, cause I never get anythign more exciting than a book or ... (my parents still stick to the old prejudice - give her a book and she'll get smarter. I prove them wrong every year). This time was quite different, cause it was my 17th birthday, and that's quite a lot. It's like a legal drinking age. As if to emphsise the impoortance of it all, my parents paired up with my sister and gave me a thousand shekels. A highly generous gesture, if you ask me, seeing as most of my time is spent begging them for some money. As the first wave of sheek swarmed through me, another problem occured: I'm simply lost in the sea of opportunities. There's about one thousand things I need and I can't decide which of them is the most dearest to my heart. For one thing, I want to buy new clothes seeing as my ankles show out of all my jeans. THat might cost al least 600 shekels, and that means I can't buy the acoustic guitar I wanted. Not taht I could buy it with one thousand shqels, but still...
Knowing me, I will prepably lose the money. Before this happnes, though, do you care to throw any ideas as if to how should I spend the money? Thanks in advance.
