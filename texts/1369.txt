We are six best friend.  We will do everything for each other.  Next week one of our classmates is getting married.  We have only one car and it is for 5 people only.  The wedding is far away and there is no way to get there by bus and taxi is very expensive.

What should we do?  Should we make 2 trips?  Should we all miss the wedding?  Should we send one of us by a taxi and we all split the money?  Please help us.
