One time, I walked with my friend to my home and oops! she ECHLIKA on a banana! Then we call to MADA and they sent us an ambulans. When we get to the Hospital. we tried to find a doctor, but we didn't ITZLACHNU. But then the doctor came to us and said: "It's not very RETZINI. You and your friend go home". Then I said to the doctor: "But she ECHLIKA on a banana..." end we all laughed!
