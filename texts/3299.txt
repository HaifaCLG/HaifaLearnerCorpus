I want to tell you about my cousn's wedding.
They came from French to celebrete ther marrige in Jerusalem. All our family came to the wedding and we enjoyed very much. What that as special on this wedding was that the couple was DATIIM and the boys and the girls didnt dance together. It was wired that I couldn't dance with my father and my grandfather, but also I was very dilated to dance with my sister I didnt see since the last summer
The food that was served was ok, I ate a lot because I was very hungry. To sum up The wedding was fine and I saw all my family that I haven't seen for a long tme.
