I eat lunch every day at 13:30 - 14:00, sometimes I eat pizza or chicken but I most to eat meat, thats what my mom says.
I eat dinner at 19:00. I eat egg and bread with cheese and sometimes we (me and my family) buy food from mama mia.
Sometimes I eat breakfast if I have time. After school I sometimes buy sweets with my friends and at home I make me a sandwich at 16:00.
In Sunday, Monday, tuesday, Wednesday and thursday I eat normal meal with my sister and brother (my perents works) and at Friday I eat a big meal with all my family.
My favorite meal in the day it lunch because I eat without my perents and I cat eat and watch TV or play the computer at the same time!
I like the most: chocolate, pizza, humburger, and all the things that my mother hates - I'm a good son! because it's tastes good.
I hate lemon, avocado and tona. I don't know why I just hate it...
