Do you know I told my son when we see in the TV room in our house in Israel, I’ve a dream 30 years ago I wanted to come Israel but my parents didn’t to my all the stories about Israel so  my but all the things I try to told my parents did help my.  So I planned to escape to Israel.  The years was 1998 I told my son and we couldn’t get on a plain and fly to Israel, so I planned to get on a ship and sail to Turkey and from there I planned to walk to Israel.

So I packed a few things and in the middle of the night I left my house and I left a message to my parents that I went to Israel and don’t worry to my I will send you a letter when I get Israel by yours son, and I left.  I get on a ship and sail to Turkey it’s took my 3 weeks when I get Turkey I walked around and I didn’t know what to do suddenly I heard that someone is going to Israel by a car and I asked him if I can joined to him and he agreement it’s took us another 4 day we went to Israel through Jordan and Lebanon and the end we come to Israel I thanked him and went to my friend who came Israel a month before I send a  letter to my parents and after a long conversation they come Israel a year later and now I am sitting in my house and I very happy.
