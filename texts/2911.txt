When I wake up in the morning I drink tea and eat a cookie or piece of a cake. It give my enerjy to start the day. In the school I eat bread with white cheese. When I come back from school I eat my lunch - usually rise or potatos with chiken or fish. In the evening I eat usually tost with yellow cheese or bread with cheese with salad and kofie.
Usually, during the day, between lunch and dinner, I eat an apple, a bannana, korneflaks or popkoren.
sometimes after dinner I drink choco, and eat chocolate.
In the weekend, I usually eat bigger meals.
On firday's evening, we all go to my father's family and eat sabih. On saterday we all go to my mother's family and eat a big lunch.
The most important meal is the breakfast beecause it gives enerjy to start the day.
I really like pizza and Burekas - but it's not healthy so I try to eat it once a two weeks.
