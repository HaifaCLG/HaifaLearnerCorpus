In last your at my  school a girl have been raped.  A strange man enter to school and in the toilet raped the girl.  When I heard this I was very frightened from this incident.  I’m looking very carefully at places like the school gate, kindergarten fences and places like this with children.

This violent incident is one of many violent incidences that happen all the time in Israel.  The violence isn’t towards/against children only, we are exposed to violence at the cinema, television as viewer.  We are exposed to violence in the streets, shouts, road accidents. This not a special place anymore. We don't meet danger. We pretend it not happen. This not a safe place for anyone.
