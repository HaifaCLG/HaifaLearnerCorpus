In our country have now decided to give Golan, and have some people that say don’t give Golan.


I think that you must give Golan because we need peace with all the world.


I don’t think like you, because the Golan is at the centre of our life.


What it’s mine our life.


Like I said Golan is the centre in Israel and Golan not be in our hand, and give Golan to under they can attack us, besides in the Golan can see the all north in Israel.


Oh I see.  I think that it’s hard decide.  Well, that’s for both of you.


You’re welcome.
