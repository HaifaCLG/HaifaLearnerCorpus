I am 17 years old girl, and as a student in the educational system and a teenager as well, I felt I must write to you my opinion about your article.

I believe that the key to success is in discipline!  The students who studying in my school, feel free to do what they want.  Most of the time they are not coming to classes and because they never been punished they keep doing it.  They need and even have to study, but they are too young to realize that!  My opinion is that the teachers must punish the students who never study.  Iâ€™m sure they be angry at first but in the long run it is the best for them.
