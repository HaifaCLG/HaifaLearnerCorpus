It was 2 years ago when my parent's we're at work and my sisters weren't at home they were in school. It was 11 o clock in the morning. We finished at 10.30 and I went back home. When I arrived home I took my key and opened the door. The house was dark because it was winter. The windows were closed. And it was raining. I went inside to the living room and put my bag on the floor. Suddenly I heard a little noise. I didn't noticed nothing so I went to the kitchen. Now I heard a bigger noise of a moving door that someone opened it, went out and closed it. I was very frightened, I was sure I saw a men. I went back to the door, got out and tried to look for him, bit he was faster than  me and run away I want to the neighbors house and call the police. I was shaking and very afraid.
