Hello my name is <NAME OMITTED>. I want to tell you about my family. I am 16 years old, and my relationship with my parents is very bad, especially with my father. Our life is a big conflict; we are fighting on every little detail.


Very well my father died when I was just 5 years old. My mother got married again 3 years later. I was shocked when I saw him the first time. Suddenly you see a stranger which becomes to be your father. It is very difficult, from this moment we are all the time fighting. He, I mean Jo, want me to share with him as a father my problems. Why should I? My mother is the one that suffer from this situation – she tries desperately to bridge on our problems.


2 months ago, I decided to go away from home. I went to the park and spend night in there. It was a terrible mistake. I will not do it again. My mother was very worried and when I came home, she gave me a very hard slap. I got not brothers and sisters, it very difficult to live in a house like that – well.
