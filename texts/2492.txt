At the "Big summer" I fly to France with my mother and my sister. I was a group trip. There was allot of kids in my age and it was very fan. We went to the "Ifel tawer" and then we saw all of Paris. it was beautiful. After we were in France we drove to Holand. Belgia and England. In England we saw allot of prety things.
