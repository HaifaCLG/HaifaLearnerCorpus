In the day I eat 3 meals. In the morning I eat brackfast - I drink a tea and eat cake every day. About 2 clock I eat a lunce hotdogs or Amburger with potetos or spageti. I don't eat afternoon I wait to dinner and eat sometimes egg or omlate with veggtebles slats some of tometo and quieckambers.
I friday, the end of the week, we eat all my family a regular diner like every day in a week. In My opinion I like very much the diner because I love very much cheese and vegtebles, I didn't like a meat or cheken.
