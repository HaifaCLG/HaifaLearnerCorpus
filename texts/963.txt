One day I was sitting in the sun next to me classroom I suddenly saw my English teacher in front of me. Next to my lovely teacher there was another woman. When we sat in the classroom the other woman started to speak. Her English was very strange and I could not understand a thing of what she said. A few minutes later I find myself writing about the most interesting thing that happened to me lately.
