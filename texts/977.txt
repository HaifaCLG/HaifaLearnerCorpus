It was very dark outside. The time was eleven in the evening and the street was empty. There wasn't any light in the street and I was afraid to walk there. I return from a big party in my friend's house. It was really great. When I was walking in the street I thought I must reach to my house as fast as possible. After five minutes of walking I heard footsteps behind me. I was very scaring and I began to walk faster as my steps became faster the steps that I heard become also faster my heart was knocking very hard.
Now, I was running my breather almost taken of me, and I think I was very near to faint. When I reached to the fence of my house, I suddenly felt a big and heavy hand on my shoulder, I gave a big shout and turn to the man, he was wearing a black coat. It looked so familiar. Yes it was my uncle Benjamin, he wanted to give me the key to my house but he couldn't shout me to stop because his through is very hurt him on there days it was a big surprise to me.
