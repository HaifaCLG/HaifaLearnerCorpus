I agree that overcrowding in the classroom might be a problem sometime at summer when the days are hot.

Sometimes, it's not convenient for the students to speak in a class which is very crowded.

I think the solution is that classes be split and taught in two shifts â€“ one class in the morning and the other half afternoon.

But there is many disadvantages on this situation.  It won't be so straight if one half of the class will be able to sleep late every day while the other half will wake up early and go to school.

The other disadvantage is that the class will not be able to spend time together as a whole class.
