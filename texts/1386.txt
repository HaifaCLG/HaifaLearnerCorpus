Yesterday me and my husband went to a show not very popular show but something that I wanted to see,  Then in the middle of the show I saw one actor that looked very familiar.  I looked at the program and I saw the name Ralf Orny.  This name was very familiar for me.  He was my of my best friend in the school, from the 5 grade we was together.  We was very close one each other.  I knew all his secrets and we have fun together.

He has a dream.  The dream was going after him and all he was doing was connect to his dream.  He wanted to be a actor, not regular actor, a very famous one.  His whole life was around the dream, and some time he was a actor, not in the show, in the life.

He went to drama activities and when was a show in the school or class he was the main actor.  He like this very much and he wanted this most.  Some time he also pull me into the drama activities too, but it wasn’t for me, I always likes to watch the show, not to be in them.

But I went to my way, in the 9 grade me and my family went to another country and he stay in the country.  And I wasn’t hear of him.  But yesterday when I see him I wasn’t very surprised because I knew that one day he become a actor.

After the show I went behind the scenes and talk with him.  It was nice meeting.  He was surprise to see me.  He also knew that one day he become a famous actor, and he did all he can to have that dream come true.

Idea to change:-  I saw this show in abroad and he a very famous actor there.  In the first when I want to see my friend, I can’t go to there because no one could see the famous actor, but in the end I saw him.
