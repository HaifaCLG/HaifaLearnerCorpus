“I don’t believe it!”  I told my best friend Shilla.  “I was dreaming about it for years and now it’s going to come true.  Can you believe it?”  “I believe that dreams come true, because you came when I wished for you”.

I began singing an old song.

We were sitting in the “Times Square” in New York.  We always came here to look at people.  I really love it.  Shilla thought it was boring so I usually came alone.  But today was a special day for me.  I was spending about 3 years in New York, meeting any musician I heard of, any records producer and something came out of the whole thing.  I managed to get a contract with a famous record company.  “He loved it, didn’t her?  I saw he loved it.”  “Yeah, he sure did.  You know what?  You deserve it.  If I was you, I was giving up the whole thing long time ago.  I’m going to be famous singer’s best friend, that’s something!”  “I’ll begin recording my first album the next month.  You know I’m really tired of walking around those nightclubs, trying to convince everybody I’m serious.  That I’m unlike others.  This month we’re going rest and celebrate.  Because I’ll be a busy person the following months of course.”

“Yeah, you better work out.  The competition is very hard and tough.  Only the best survive.

“Trust me.  I’ve done the most hard part of the whole thing.  Now I’m going work.

“You better, our financial situation is not the best.  Actually I have only 10$ right now.”

”And because I have no money at all you’ll invite me for a pizza or something>”  “The same story again?” “Yeah, I can see the headlines – The famous rich signer had to eat pizza all day to survive.
