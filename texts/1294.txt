On one hand, I think it is a good suggestion that the classes will be split and taught in two shifts â€“ it has advantages, to students in a class are too much.  When so many people sit in a room and want to study together, it is hard.  It is difficult to focus when a lot of people sit in the same room specially when they are your friends and disturb you by talking or laughing with you.  Another advantage is that the teacher can't handle with so many kids so now she will be able.  It is very difficult for her.  But on the other hand, I think this suggestion has disadvantages.  I don't think children want to study in the afternoon.  Afternoon is time for playing, watching TV, going out with friends not studying!  I think it is better to study in the morning, and you also can be more focused.  Another thing is that it is not a good idea to split a class!  The children in the class are friend and like each other you can't cause them not to be together and study together!  It is harmful thing to do to children.
