The exact definition of a hero is – a man respected for bravery. This is, in general, a character we are exposed to: in movies, plays, stories and etc…

let's notice that exact movie build on solid historical facts is equipped with a hero character, even if there were no participating heroes in original events (the movie "Titanic" is a good example: in the original event there were no noticeable heroes but in the movie we breathlessly followed De Caprio.





In my opinion, a hero is a leader and an expression of perfection. The writer, the director, the books, the story-tellers – all of them deliver the plot with a help of a hero.

The main question is still, of course, why our society needs a hero.

From the beginning of the human history, people had the need in a hero leader- a strong personality that will guide them in everything they do. People were guided by shamans, preachers, emperors, kings, dictators and presidents. People find themselves in a situation, were each individuals life could not be documented (cause were too many), that's why the history based on heroes actions.

During ages many historical facts were forgotten, and many myths and legends were created. Combine the two – and that's how people got mythical heroes. These hero leaders were and are going to exist forever, because people have the need in them. The society is inspired by their actions, their way of living, their habits, deeds, thoughts, almost everything, even if the society could not like them. People desperately need this superman character, because it makes them fear less in this hostile world. People have to be guided by a hero people must pin all their hopes on the hero.



In conclusion, a hero is a character that should possess the finest qualities of each one of us, and serve as a model of imitation for the society.
