Dear Jeff,
How are you?
I need to tell you something very important!
As you know, my uncle died last month and, I got from him a lot of money. He decided that his money only I and my brother would get.
I though what can I do with the big money and I decided to keep him for my study when I will be in the university. Maybe I will buy Sony playstation III and stuff like this but most of the money sure I will keep for the university.
Will you do the same like me?
see you soon,
...
