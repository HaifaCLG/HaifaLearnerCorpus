Apparently, I wouldn't be abel to find the perfect words for describing the next story. Our neighbourhood is swarming with cats, whose long daily complaints in a form of yells and scratches. Imagine two little girls, bored to death, in the heat of the summer vacation, claiming up the tree to catch a random cat whose big fortune was that those girsl were me and my kindly smiling friend. He tought we tried to pull him down called him all his favorite nicknames, but he was marter. In vain we tried to get away from our little sweaty hands for we grasped the poor suaggy creature tightly and calmed him down by explaining basic rules of cat washing.
To his defense it would be said he was absolutely helpless in our hands. I'm leaving it here for you to judge whether the good meaning justify the act.
