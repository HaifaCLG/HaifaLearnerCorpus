The most moving thing that ever happened to me was a year ago, my father was coming break after along time that he being travelling around the word, it was his job to travel and found new thing about the animal in the forrest. My mother and my father divorce when I was three years old and from that time I didn't see him. He left the house and never come back. My mother and I didn't talk a lot about him. My father called every month to tell us where he is and to ask my how I fill and that all, I missed him and wanted him to come back but he said all the time that he would love to but he can't he send my a lot of things for my birthday. Some day will I was doing my boring homework the phone ring my father was taking from the end of he phone, I was happy to hear him and we take about a few thing and at the end he said, I will come to visit you visit my I answered him yes, he said I jumped and laughed and screamed with happiness. he told my the day and the hour he will be at the airport, were we will meet. The day before I had to met him I couldn't sleep all the time I thought of him. How he will look like, how sound with more and more curious. In all the day at school I couldn't study and when I come back I couldn't eat. I was excited and tired from the day. I didn't sleep that I fell asleep. Then I heard a knock in me door then I saw my mother. I smiled with a big smile. But my mothers look was very frightened. I ask mother what happened. She sat next to my and pat my and said your father your father is gone. I asked were did he go and my mother with tears in her eyes he gone he isn't alive any more . I said with surprise looking no he can't he had to be alive. I scream and cry with all my heart I couldn't stop my self. My fault for loving father I didn't saw him all this hours why did he live? my why?
