(1) In my life, I wake up in the morning every day for a new beatiful world and I hope to a great day. so I usually wake up in the morning, first I eat breakfast corns usually and then brush my teeths. after that I wear somthing and my school whirt, a uniform. then I drive to school in bus and dont late.
