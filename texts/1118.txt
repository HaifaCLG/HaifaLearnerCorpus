I practice in self defense Israel Union two years. Now I have a blue belt and in the previous summer vacation I had a green belt and I had a competition I was pretty good and the competition started at 10.30. I had to fight in orange belt, with green belts 2 boys, and a boy with a blue belt in the 55 kilo-14, 15, 16 ages and my age was nearly. The two fights were easy to me and I won but after them I was tired but I won in the third fight too, then the time was 15.00 and I was very tired and I had to fight against a boy that was one level higher than me in the blue belt, and I was injured in my leg and my time to fight came. The fight was very difficult but I stood and fought in brave, two times I dropped my rival but suddenly I got a kick in my leg a very hard kick and I fell down and I can't move my leg and my coach looked for me but I could not continue in the fight and my rival got the first place and the gold medal and I got the second place and the silver medal.


I think that my writing is better now, more easily for me to write, I think that writing in English is little difficult from Hebrew because I don't know all the words in English.
