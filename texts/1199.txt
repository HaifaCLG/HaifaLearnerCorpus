I would like to describe a violent incident I witnessed this afternoon between two drivers on the road.  I was on my way to the school, suddenly the two drivers who stopped before my car started to horn each other.  One of the drivers went out of his car to the other car, he knocked on the car’s window and kicked the car.  I continued driving and I still don’t know the reason for this incident.  But still we can see almost every day that roads, schools, families and even nursery children are becoming more violent.  All this incidents that we are hearing about them every day are the mirror of what is currently happening in Israel:  people are less patient, less kind and more violent/  It makes me think that maybe Israel is not the right place to raise up children.
