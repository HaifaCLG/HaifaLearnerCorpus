My bar mitzva
I celebrated my bar mitzva at "Marom"'s hall. It was very fun.
First, me, my sister, my parents and a friend of mine, came to the hall very early. Then all the guests came and we ate. Then a clip about my life was shown.
After that my parents and my sisters blessed me. I was really sad when it ended because I really had fun and wanted to go through it again.
