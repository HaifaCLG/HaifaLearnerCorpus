Dear Ron,
Hi, last I have invited video game that called "Tenaclons D" I sent the game to microsoft and they bought it for 1,000,000,000$, I have met Bill Gates and he gave me a check.
I was so happy that I invited all the freinds to vacation in exslusive Hotel in New york.
In that vacation I gave all of them a "Porsue" car they were so happy (sorry for not inviting you).
I can buy every thing I want last week I have bought an tropical Island.
I could by an House in Shan Zeliza if I want to or an yacht, I Don't know what to do with this money so I boght an soccer team that called "chelsea". It cost 700,000,000$ but its good investment.
I want to know what you would do if you had all the money I have?
your freind...
