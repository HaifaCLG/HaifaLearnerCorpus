The events in the picture are happening in a school garden at the brake. There are some charecters in the picture, like, to kids that are playing basketball, a girl that is listening to music, a boy that is playing the guitar, some kids that are reading books, two girls that are telling secrets each other, and a teacher that is yelling on a boy. I think that the boys who are playing basketball are atlets, and the girls are good friend if they trust each other, and girl that is listening to music is alone because she don't have any friend. There are some things that take our attention, like, a broke window that we can guss that the boy who the teacher yells at him broke the window, shoes on the window that someone put them their, and a graffity picture that someone painted.
