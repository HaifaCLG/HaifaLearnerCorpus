Finish taking all my Bagrut examination â€“ it sound like a dream.  But this dream is going to come true at the end of the year!

What am I going to do then?

At first, I am going to put all the books in some box and send it to somewhere.  And after that I am going to celebrate my friends!!!  I plan to go to some trips, maybe in Ramat Hagolan, maybe in the Negev.  I am going to spend time with friends and just to do things that I like to do.

Despite that I am talking about the Bagrut examination and I am talking about punishment.  I know how much the Bagrut is important to my future.  With the Bagrut I will go to the university and with the Bagrut I will find a job.  That why we need to work hard.
