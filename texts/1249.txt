This time I’ll write about big problem that my schools are dealing with today.  It’s the overcrowding in the classroom.  In one school they asked the opinion of the pupils and one suggested to split the class and to teach in two shifts.  Half the class in the morning and half in the afternoon.

On my opinion it is not a good solution because those who learn in the afternoon won’t be focus but on the other hand it’s also hard to focus when there is an overcrowding in the classroom.

My suggestion is that to split the class and to make 2 classes or if they don’t have an available classroom they need to get an air conditioner to the classroom.

I think I would have gone out of my mind with a lot of girls in my classroom or if I hadn’t had my own space.  I hope they will have a better solution than I suggested or if you have one we will be happy to hear it, so please write us.
