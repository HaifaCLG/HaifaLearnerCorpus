My bat mitzva:
Last year I had bat mitzva at 16th July, 2009.
I celebrate with my freinds and with my family. I wear a white drees and white shoes.
My frinds told me that I looked graet.
We danced and sang, and I relly enjoyed.
I sang a song thet I relly like.
I also took thotos from my bat mitzva.
