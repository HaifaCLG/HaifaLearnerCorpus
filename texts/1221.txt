Are you crazy?! Only  because we be in terrorist attacks we can’t drive to Hebron.

Yes.  Do you want to kill us.  Are you nuts!?

I nuts, you nuts, it’s our city and we are allowed to be and go to there.

Did you forget that we have just attack by terrorist/

I not forget but I insist on going to Hebron as we planned.

Ok.  I see that you don’t listen to me so I stay in my way and when you going to change your opinion call me.

No, no, no.  You stay here and listen to me.  This is our country and we must stay here and fight on this land.

No we must live in peace with the Arabs all over this country.

If we don’t stay and fight then we will lose this land and have no where to live.

That is not true it will be our place always.
