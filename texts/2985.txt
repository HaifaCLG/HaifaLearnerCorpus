When I celabrate my bat mitzva, 3 years ago, I was very stressed. The "bat mitzva was very happy and the peoples who came danced and sang. The meal was very good, and the food was very testy. My family were stressed like me. My friend, people from mother's and father's work came to my bat mitzva. All the people had fun (I'm think...). I get a nice presents.
