My mother is a doctor so I eat always home made healthy meals.
Everyday I eat 3 meals a day, breakfast, lunch and supper.
in the morning I usually eat cereals, in the noon I eat meat, rise and a little bit salad, and at the evening just yogurt.
I eat sanwitch at school and an apple after lunch.
There isn't much different between the meals, in the weekend I usually eat eggs and Kotage instad of cereals.
My favourite meal is the "lunch", I love my mom's home made cook.
The most important meal is breakfast it helps me to start the day, it gives me energy.
