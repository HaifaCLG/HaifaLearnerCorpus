Everyday my day started at the morning before school. when I wake up I drink some tea and some cookies with it. After the school I eat the food that my mother made before a day. Every two days it changes. It almost meet and something with it. In the evening I eat milk with corenflex, sometimes it salat with koteg. In the end of the day I eat fruit. For example, apples, and orange. My weekend some different from the all days because in Fridays my mother makes food to sutterday that different from the original days. I don't have speical food that I prefere, all the food that is made I eat and enjoy. All the meals that reach in oil I don't like because it isn't healthy food and demage our health, I prefer vegatabels and healthy meal, reach in vary of good ingredients.
