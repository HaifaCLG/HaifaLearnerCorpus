Dear Adam,
I get 5,000 shekels to my "bar mitzva" I get 3,000 from my parents and 2,000 from the other family, I don't know what to do with my money I wanna buy a comuter or TV or trip to USA, What do you think that I should do with the money?
I think wont to trip to USA because its more beutifull from a computer and its a chance for me to see the world. By the way, what's going on dude?
I hope you will answer my letter.
Love...
