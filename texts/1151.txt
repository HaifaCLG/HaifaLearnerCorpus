My writing process:
I can't say I really feel any change in he way I write now, but I guess I can't feel this change because I improved myself slowly. But I do feel it's easy for me to write now. Actually it wasn't really hard to write.  The topics were quite interesting and I had ideas. The bad thing was to rewrite the compositions.
I think that writing in English is a little bit different from writing in Hebrew because there are those certain words you need to use but you don't know how to say it, and if you do know you sometimes don't know how to write it. That's the problem, but I guess that if I had to write about the same topic in Hebrew I would write the same.
*Please I don't want any of my compositions to be read by all the pupils.
