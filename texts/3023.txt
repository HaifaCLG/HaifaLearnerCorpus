Dear Isaac,
You wont believe what I got for my birthday! I got 5,000 dollars from my parents. I was so excited. The first thing I did was shopping. I went to buy clothes, a cellphone, more clothes...haha...
I want to save most of the money. I really want to come and visit you guys in America. My parents will give me a little more money and I will come.
It will make me so happy.
What would you do if your parents gave you that amount of money?
Yours
forever
PS.
I miss You!
