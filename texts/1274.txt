The day I finally finish taking all my Bagrut examination will be one of the most exciting day, for bad and for good in my life.  When it happens, I will have mixed feeling.

On one hand I will be glad, because after all, I have been suffering from these study for a long time.  I have not had enough time to be with my family in events such as Shabbat, holidays or family trips.  In addition, I haven’t went out enough with my friends some places.  Moreover, I haven’t enjoyed other diversions like watching TV, playing the computer or reading a book.  Instead, I have had to learn for the examinations, do projects and homework.

But on the other hand I will be upset.  After 12 years of studies (that sometimes can be fun and interested) I have to leave it behind.  Another reason I will be sad – I have to break with my friend who have shared with me these years.

I don't know how I'm going to celebrate but it will be something that I will never forget!
