In my opinion, the solution to split the class and teach in two shifts, to deal with overcrowding in the classroom isn't such a good solution.

First of all, it is known that the best time to study is in the morning.  Second of all, learning in the afternoon won't leave the students enough time for their homework, that's because they will prefer sleeping until late in the morning instead of doing their homework.  Another reason is because it isn't fair to split a class after they studied together for some time.  All the students want to learn with their friends,

From these reasons and more I believe that this is not the best solution to this problem.  There must be a better solution to the problem â€“ a solution which is more useful and which has less advantages than this one.
