Now I am 21 years old after army and I'm thinking about the good old days in school compare the army and compare the life now. I think about the old friends that I have in the school and the fun that we did in the school. I didn't see them a lot of time. I remember that someone from the class brought to life 'boom' to the class that make a lot of noise and some of the pupil from the class take the 'boom' to the grove near and blow it and this boom was so little but she made so much noise that all the pupil heard this boom. I was sitting on the grass in the school and when I heard this noise I thought someone blow the school and every body wonder who blow this boom.
This was an experience that I never forget I thing that school was far compare now.
