Last summer a group of nine children from London, 12 - 16 years old, visited in our town. Each one of them stayed with one of the Israeli group for two weeks. At the beginning, two or tree first days, we didn't mix with them almost at all. But in the following days and the trips we became good friends. When they went back to England many children cried. The one who stayed in my house was the oldest there, 16 years old. His name is Richard and he is a very nice person but the first week we didn't get so close because we both are shy, but the second week was much better. The trips we went to were very interesting and some of them where to places I never visited such as an army airport. In the free days we went to the swimming pool of our city and stayed there a lot of us for the whole day. Next summer, we will go to England and I am sure it will be much more interesting.
