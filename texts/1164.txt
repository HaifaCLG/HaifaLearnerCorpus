Hi mom!  How are you?  Mom!  I want to go the disco tonight.


With whom are you going to go?


I going to go with Shy.  He invited me today.


Who is Shy?


I met him in the supermarket.  He is a very good boy!


How do you know he is a good boy?


He treats me very nicely and was polite to me.  I think he is a wonderful boy.  Also he is nice.


OK.  I understand.  You like this boy and want to go with him, but you can’t go tonight.


Mom, why?


Because tonight you have to stay at home with your small brother.


No.  I can’t stay because I promised Shy.  I can stay with my brother tomorrow.


Thank you, but tomorrow and I can stay with him and today I must go to the hospital.


Mom!  What should I do?  What should I say to Shy?


Tell him you can’t go.  If he is a good boy he will understand you,.  You can go with him tomorrow.,


OK mom.  I’ll tell him about this.


My opinion:  I fight with my mother very seldom because usually she understands me.  But sometimes I should do what she wants.
