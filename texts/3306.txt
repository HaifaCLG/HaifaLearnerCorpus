Dear Or li.
How are you?
I am writing you this letter because I want to tell you about my birthday.
My birthday was 2 days ago and I got a lot of money from by family because it was my 16 birthday.
At first I didnt know what to do with the money because there are a lot thing I wanted to buy.
Then I decided to talk with my mother about it and she advised me to keep the money and to not spend all at once.
Acording to my mother's advice I decided to not spend all the money so I took a little part of it and went to shooping.
You know how much I like to buy cloths.
I dont know yet what to do with the rest of the money.
If you were me, what would you do?
To sum up I hope I wont to spend the money on stupied things as I'm used to.
I'm waiting to your answer.
Love...
