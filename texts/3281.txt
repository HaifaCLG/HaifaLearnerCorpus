My family prepearations for my sisters wedding were realy bng, beautiful and exhausted.
My sister went to a bride salon she was beautiful after the family reunion before the wedding she cried with my mother and was very tensed.
The first wedding arraanements was to find a place to celebrate it, by size and payment.
The wedding was beautiful me and the groom were very tensed and started to shake at the chupa. After they got married we started to dance the main music was middle east music everyone had fun and the food was incredibly delicious.
The special event in my sister's wedding was my cousin 17th birthday at the same date so we had a double fun.
For sum up I enjoyed the whole evening and everyone that I've asked (family, cousins, grandma, grandfather and friends) said it was thrilling and amazing.
