Since the foundation of the country, Israel is the main target for Jewish immigrants from all over the world, but from Europe comes the most significant, the main reason for that was the holocaust during WWII.

Many immigrants came from distant places and had many differences both in culture and in physical appearance.  Which led to conflicts between the immigrants to the local population and also between the different groups of immigrants.

Although the “crazy” and unstable beginning most of the immigrants found their place in the Israeli society and culture and in many aspects of the Israeli reality.

Almost all the citizens in Israel have roots in a different place.  So everybody are somewhat immigrants.  Some are just the children and grandchildren of immigrants and some are fresh immigrants that just arrived, but no matter the how long we live in this country the most important part is that we all humans.
