I woke up in the morning with a strange filling. Oh I have to go to school. I made all the usual arrangement. Got dressed, took my bag and went to the bus stop. I just sat down when the bus arrived all the way I thought about the day that will through by studying instead of enjoying at the city or in the sea. It was a beautiful day and I couldn't see me sitting in a cold class, trying to learn something.
At the brakes, me and my friends sat on the lawn laughing at teachers and people from the class, I think we made too much, because the manager come out and asked us to relax a little and to go to the class. we didn't fill like studying then, so we took our bags and left the class and the school. We walked at the orchards around the school until we got to the sear. It was fun to sit on the sand, in the sun, to fill free. It was grate. Be we have not felt so, when at the other day we all punished and stayed for 7 hours for 2 weeks at school every day.
