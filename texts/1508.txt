The strong desire to be or do something, and the desire to improve your status in the world is called “ambition”.  Some people success as a result of wanting to get on in the world, whereas, other people suffer for being ambitious.  Hence, ambition would be a good thing if the person acts positively towards fulfilling his dreams, on the other hand, ambition may cause troubles if the person thinks or acts negatively.

We consider ambition to be a good thing since, in many cases the concept of ambition is positive.  Furthermore, our view about ambitious person is mostly good.  Actually, ambitious person means that he will do new and different things in order to serve his society and improve himself.  Consequently, he will be a useful element in the society.

Moreover, ambitious people get new better status in society which is a reason to push them forward.  Their perspective about life is very clear, who he works more gets more, that is absolutely right in their opinion.

However ambition changed during time, to please individual desires only.  The desire to be the best, in addition to possess the whole world leads many people to betray, kill and damage.  Owing to Hitler’s aggressiveness and his movements bad treatment millions of innocent people were killed.

Hitler was a symbol of unlimited ambition.  His desires led him to kill people in a wild way.  He had done all of this just to fulfil his dreams, however he failed because of people’s desire to survive.  Some ambitious people take advantage of the people in order to make their dreams come true.  They don’t take other people’s needs into consideration.  In addition they are ready to do everything just to get their aims.

Finally, * ideas are not always come true, sometimes they stay only ideas.  So it’s necessary to take into consideration those people who cannot fulfil their dreams and think about the psychological damage that they can face if they not success in achieving their aims.
