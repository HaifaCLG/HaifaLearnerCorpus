I got from my parents 5,000 shekels to my sweet 16. I took 1,500 Shekels and I decided to spend this money for clothes. I was in Keryon and I bought 4 T shirts and 2 jeans. In the future I will buy new table to my room - it's important because I make my homework many times on the table. What will you do with 5,000 shekels if your parents will give you this money?
