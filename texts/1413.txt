Almost everyone asks himself at some point of his life which is the best way to live: is it better to live in the city or in the country? There are many differences between living in the city and living in the country. The differences are both in the mentality and the people’s characteristics.

One of the differences between living in the city and living in the country is the environment. There are high buildings and industrial factories in the city. You can mostly see the color grey  everywhere. There is much traffic in the city; therefore, there is a lot of air pollution. In addition, there is too much noise in the city. However, in the country, there are many trees, flowers, and the color green is everywhere. The houses are mostly private houses with fields and farms. There is less air pollution, less noise and it’s very tranquil since there aren’t entertainment services such as: cinemas, theatre, restaurants etc.; the nightlife is simple and quiet in the country.

In the city, there is fast access to all kinds of services, whereas in the country you can only have access to the main services. There are many kinds of services such as: post offices, banks, supermarkets, malls, a police station. Furthermore, there are cinemas, theatres, pubs, restaurants which make the night life richer. On the other hand, the only services to be found in the country are a local grocery store and a small clinic. Due to the poor variety of services in the country, people usually go to the city to use the services they don’t have in the country.
