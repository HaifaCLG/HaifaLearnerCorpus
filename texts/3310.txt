The picture is about a school, probably in Israel, because it has the title of school in Hebrew. The school gates are close but it is the break time, because everyone is outside. There are some vandals at school that draw a graphiti on walls, break windows and hang shoes from other top windows. There are two kids talking in the middle of the picture and two kids are talking on the grass. Near the kids htere is someone playing a guitar. There is also a teacher yelling on one of the students. There are two teenagers playing basketball and one of them is about to throw the ball. the last student in the picture is sitting near the edge of the school and listenning to music.
