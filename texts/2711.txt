Dear Alex
Today is my birthday and I got 1,000 shekels from my uncle.
I don't know on what spent this money I thought maybe spent them on new computer or TV but I think I will put the money on the bank and save them for spending in the future.
in the letter that I got from my uncle was allsow a congragulation letter I called him to thank him for the prasent he contrtulated my again and tell me to use the money with brane.
your friend...
