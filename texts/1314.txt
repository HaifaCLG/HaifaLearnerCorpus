In front of me I see many things on the table.  The table is a small one which have a very nice blue table cloth.  The most obvious thing on the table is the big silver vase with the yellow flowers in him.

To the right of this vase there is a small butter dish which also has a silver color.  Near the butter dish I see a white plate, on the plate there are, a pink napkin, a silver knife and one small tangerine.  There are another two tangerines on the table, one near the plate and the second near a green apple.  In the middle of the table I see a white cup and saucer with another silver cutlery on him, to the left of the cup and saucer I see an empty milk jug, and on the right of this white milk jug, there is the candle holder, the candle is white and mot of the holder is brown!
