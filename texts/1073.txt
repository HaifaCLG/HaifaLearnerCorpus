I came from Ramat Hasharon and I want to tell you about my school before this school. The schools name Shazar of the mean Zalman Shazar and the school in Kfar Saba the children from Ramat Hasharon must go to this junior high and in high school we choose were we want a go and I came to this school. But in Shazar school I really hate it. The teacher was good but the pupils were very very bad in my mind they were bad. I hate them they always thought about close and how they were looking and always were barbaric I mind they do things just for their friend will see how they good and the broke windows and doors and more thing that I really don't like. My 3 more girl fried from Ramat Hasharon goes with them they like them at the beginning but in this time I was alone but is really don't bother m y because I think man should be alone for sometimes in his life. But this is over now and in the last class in that school I chose this school because all the people they were with me in Shazar school go to Katzenelson school and I didn't want it so I'll came to here and I'm happy with my choice because is completely different from every things.
