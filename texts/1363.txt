The educational system in Israel goes through a very hard times.  Nowadays mostly because of the immense problems.

For my opinion education should be one of the most important things in our country.  Education is the key for a good future.

I feel as a teenager in this system, that basic education, is something that every person should have.  This basic education is twelve years of studying.

Furthermore, this country needs to support high education after twelve years of studying.  A country that has people with degrees and university education could only make this country a better place.
