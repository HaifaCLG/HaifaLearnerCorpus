When I lived in New York, I traveled a lot. One place that I really remember is the Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C. Though I don't have anyone in my family who had been in the holocaust. I wanted to know everything about it and to understand this from people that were there. When I first entered to the museum I got a little book with a lot of details inside of it, about a women that died in the holocaust. Everyone got different books. Then I started to walk around there. The order is from the beginning. How it's all started. I started to walk there and I saw a lot of pictures of people, adults and kids. When I got to the movies part, I heard about one person who survived the holocaust. His story was amazing. He described all that happened there from his point of view. When I listened to his voice, I could still heard him stammered. It was hard for him to talk more then it was hard for me to listen. I remember that I cried at this point. It was hard to understand that people didn't want Jewish a life just because they are Jewish. After the movies there I went to a stage that was full with shoes, thousands shoes were there, standing one on another. I smelt the burnt in the air. It was wonderful experience to understand all that happened there, and to look deep in to all the details. I remember that when I went out from there, I was still sat outside and couldn't believe that something like that happened. I knew that when I studied about this at school, I was too young to understand it, and I think that it wasn't deep as this "trip" was. When I went out, I sat outside on the grass, and didn't want to do anything, I didn't undersigned how people could survived this, how people could live after this. I think that everyone should go there and understand that people are just people, no color, no race and no religion should separate us. We all have to live together in love and peace.
