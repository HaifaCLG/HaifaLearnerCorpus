When I was 12 years old me and my family fly to Orlando, New Youk and Maimy.
It was so much fun. I very liked Orlandu because all the famous parks there.
This is so big! and different from Israel.
In New Yourk we meet my perent's friends and It was so great!
They are funny and very like to go adventure, like me! ther names are shoshana and Dor. And there's kid's name are Foni and Adi. Adi was also 12 years old, like me, and Roni was 13 years old.
