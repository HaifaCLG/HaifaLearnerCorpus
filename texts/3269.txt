Two years ago me and my family were invited for my uncle birthday.
The birthday was in the evening and before it started my family and I went to my uncle's house to help with all the food and the music. When the party started a lot of people came and it was very boring and regular birthday until my uncle got drunk. He started to dance and scream and it was very funny. To sum up, after all the boring parts the party was very happy and funny. I enjoyed there and I think the most of the people were enjoyed.
