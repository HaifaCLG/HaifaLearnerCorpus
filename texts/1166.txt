In my country there is argument about Returns Land.  One the one hand Israel wants to give the land because had a hope to peace with Arabs on the other hand Israel don’t want give land because if we give them land they want more land.


My Opinion is:


Although we give land they want more land we won’t have a real peace and Arabs don’t want a real peace.


Hadley, be really if it is happening to your country.  What are you doing?
