Before 2 months I went with my family to the Luna Park in tel aviv.
It was very fun and I very loved to be on the roller couster. It was scary and fun. and then we went to the giant whell and It was very tall and you can see all tel aviv.
And in the end we wen to a place that he is reach to 44 meters. You can see all the luna park and tel aviv.
And then we came home.
