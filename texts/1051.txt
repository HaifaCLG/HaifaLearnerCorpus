Now, I'm 20 years old. I'm sitting with a few of my friends from the air-force, in the army.  Do you remember that good day that we were sitting and learning. I asked yes I remember. It was really hard and I haven't had any fun, but I suppose it could be better and fun as well. I had a few teachers good teachers that it was really fun to study with them. But there was one teacher my history teacher that I really hated. Once she sent me home because I didn't hear what she was saying about something. Yes, I think that she was really ugly. I remember a good thing that happened to me: I have had there in school 3 girl friend and only because of school I met them. Yes, school was a hard time but there were also good things there.
