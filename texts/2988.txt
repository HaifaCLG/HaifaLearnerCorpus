Last week me and two of my friends went out on Friday evening. We went to eat ice cream and each of us ordered two balk of ice cream. After we finished eating the ice cream one of my friends gave me ten shekels to go buy ourselves a one and a half bottle of ice tea.
because him and the shop seller aren't in good relationship.
After we drank we started talking and walking in kirya haim. one of my friends started fooling around and throw ice tea at me so i ran a bit and accidently i ran towards the cars and almost got him. After that we went one of the friends house to get cards to play because we were bored, we didn't find place to play then my friend called me and asked me if I want to sleep at his house and I agreed and I went to my friend house. I would continue but no place plus its another event.
