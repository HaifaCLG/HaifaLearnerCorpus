Yesterday we were on a family picnic. everyone was there - my aunts, my mon's cousins and their children. oh, as usual, no one my age was there, so it was pretty boring. we ate some steaks, kababs, chicken... the adults were talking. the little kids were playing and I just sat and got bored. after we ate, one of the kids took a ball and offered me to join, I accepted, but it's annoying to play with little kids, you have to be extremely careful. but, when we started playing, one of the adults joined. and when he tried to kick the ball, he slipped and fell. he was all right, but it was funny.
