I don't eat breakfast, I eat for lunch what my mother make my, in the evening I eat with all my family salad and tosts.
every day in lunch I eat difrent thing, like: spageti pizza.
There is no difrent
I like the most meal in the lunch; I like her the most because I eat what my mother make my and I love my mother food.
