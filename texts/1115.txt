When I was in 8 years old my brother was 5 years old. I had a bicycle not small and not big. One day I drove with them and my brother came to me and said "I want to drive with you"." No I want to go to my friend and I want to go alone" I said. "Please just a little drive" "Well I said mm.. ok but you promise to be good boy all the rest of the day" "I promise I really do". "Ok come on". So I drove him on circle in the moshav. This is the time to say that we have steep path in part of the moshav and the end of that slope is next to my house.
So after I gave him a little trip he said that he wants to drive me on the bicycle of course I said no but he said "it will be fun, really you see" so I agree and I gave him to drive me we went to the start of the slope cause he want that and he started to drive and I sit behind him hold on to him. He got so excited from the drive that so he started to drive faster and faster. I told him "Nevo, drive slower" but he said "it's fun, don't worry" then he lost control on the bicycle he started to do zig zag and before I could say something, the bicycle fell on the road and two of us crash on the road, and because we drove very vast when we fell we started to move on the road. We started to cry and my parents came from the house. They cleaned us from all the blood, I have more than Nevo, and they put iodine on all the wounds and all my body was purple from the iodine.
The next day when I went to school all the kids asked "what happened to you". In the end of the day I had drama lesson and everybody had to tell what happened to him in the weekend. So I tell all the story about the bicycle and this was the most beautiful story in that day. After two wounds healed and all the pain gone but the conclusion I'll never forget, never to give somebody weak or small control especially over me.
