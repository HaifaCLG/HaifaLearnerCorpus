Last year I been on a beautiful wedding.
I was my sister's wedding. during the wedding I was dancing, ating and having a lot of fun.
All our family were on the wedding. I don't sure who managed the wedding, I gess it was my sister.
The music was great. It was our favorite music, she was schosen by my sister.
On the wedding was a lot of tasty food, but the best food that served was the ice cream at the end. it was delicious.
something fanny happaned at this wedding, when we danced some juce got on my sister's dress. whe was very upset at the beggining, but then my mother cleaned it up.
