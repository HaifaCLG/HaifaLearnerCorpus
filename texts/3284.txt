Two months ago was my grandmothers birthday. She was 70 years old and my parents thought that it had to be a big party. They invited all our family to a restoruant, my grandmother prepared to the party and she asked me to go with her to buy a dress and shoes, she was happy that I came with her and helped her in the shopping.
The party was nice, the singers was good and there was music that my grandmother love. this party wasn't intresting for me cause there was nobody in my age.
It was very funny that all our family and my grandmothers friends didn't recognized and was shocked that I changed a lot.
