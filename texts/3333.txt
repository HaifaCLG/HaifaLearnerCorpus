Dear David,
How are you?
I am fine.
I am writing to tell you about my last birthday present from my grandmother. She gave me a bag with ten million dollars.
With this money I bought By now a house with a pool, a plain, a bout and a shirt. I'm thinking about buying a resturaunt, what do you think about that?
I want to buy a resturaunt so I would eat all the time for free.
So, what would you do with the money?
