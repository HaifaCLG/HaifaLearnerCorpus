Finally free!  I had finished all of my examinations, and I feel like I am going to scream because of it.  It's a moment I have been waiting for a long time.  Finally, I can do whatever I like with my life without anyone telling me what to do.  From this moment on my life is going to change.

Soon, I will start my first year in the national service and there I will feel that I am doing something useful.  Tonight I am planning to go to celebrate my "liberation" with my friends, at the bowling â€“ we will play and have some fun because we are finally free!
