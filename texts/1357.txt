I have read the article “Israel’s Top 10 Priorities for Education of Its Children” from last week newspaper and I want to discuss about the “real” priorities of the education.

Education is very important because it’s the future of the country but for some reason the budget of the education office is reduced every year and we the students lose hours of study every week.  Teachers are losing their job and we suffer the most because how the future looks .

Unless the situations is going to improve the future of the entire country is at risk and the public should bring this issue to the newspapers and other forms of the media, so the government will understand the importance of the situation and what on stake right now.
