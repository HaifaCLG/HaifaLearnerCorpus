I picked my and my twin's bar mitzva. I really enjoyed in that event, it was great! The event was in a horse farm called "HAVAT HAROCHVIM". Me and my twin were on a horse and the horses went by themselves traveling in the mountains while me and my twin were on them. The food was great too. My surprising thing that happend in that event was i lost my necklace that my sister gave me as a present. At the end my mom found it. I was sad when i didn't feel it around my neck. But i was happy when my mom found it.
