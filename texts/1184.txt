I don’t understand why people must drive their care exactly after Shabbat is on.


I don’t understand the question at all.  Why should anybody consider when to drive his car, according to Shabbat times.


Because there are a lot of people in Jerusalem that they drive in Shabbat is hurting their feelings.


They should mind their own business and let everybody live his own life.,


But they believe that they have responsibility to keep the  Shabbat in Israel, that is the country of the Jewish people.


With all the respect to their beliefs, they should learn how to live with people that have different beliefs.





In Israel there is a group of very religious people (“charedi”) that lives according to the bible rules.  They also believe that they should watch that all the Jewish people that live in Israel would watch the Shabbat.


Because of their beliefs, they are stopping cars that drive is Shabbat.  In my belief everybody should do whatever he feel like because we are living in a free  country.
