Wow, everything is so clean. Wow, the architecture is so nice, so classic. I feel like a little kid when I see new things. Wait a minute, what is that smell in the street corner? It smells sweet, and salty? It’s a crepe stand. I don’t believe it. They sell salty crepes. Crepes with cheese, in Israel I encountered only sweet crepes (usually with Nutela). I must try it. Oh, it’s really good. It tastes like a very light toast with a hint of sweetness. I love it.


Maya lives with two Danish girls. One of them is a semi-known model, and the other one ‘just’ look good, so they are very popular among the locals. We were invited to a private party. The party takes place in an apartment in the heart of Paris. I’m mingling with Paris high society. Models, producers, fashion designers, musicians, and more are all around. Is this for real? Till now I only saw parties like that on TV programs. I’m amused. There is a huge line to the toilet. Too long, I’m curious. Everyone that goes out of the toilet is scratching his nose. Some of them have a bit of white powder on the tip of their nose?! I’m laughing. By now I’m a bit drunk. There are amazing sounds all around, so I’m heading to the D.J. area. I have never heard music like that. It’s a kind of electronic new age combined with French hip-hop, interesting. I enjoy it a lot, but I think that personally I’ll stick to my favorite, which is psychedelic electronic music. That party was a party to remember. Not because it was that good, but because it was that different from what I’m used to. From Maya I headed to Amsterdam and The Hague, and from there I went back to India and Thailand. After Thailand I found myself in Hungary just in time for the full solar eclipse. The solar eclipse will be a subject for another assignment probably.


All that and more happened in the summer of 99’.
