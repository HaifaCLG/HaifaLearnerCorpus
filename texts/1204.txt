One day while I was driving my car toward my house, I wanted to move from the right side of the road to the left one.  While I was doing so, one car driver started horning at me, shouting yelling and cursing.

I felt like he was going to kill me although I didn’t commit any mistake.

This kind of incident happens every day.  As an Israeli citizen I feel like I’m living in a violent country, in a violent society.  Once I get on the road I feel more tense, more ready to struggle.  I feel like on one hand I’m ashamed to be called Israeli;  on the other hand I feel that the manly side of identity is coming out in order to survive – and I don’t like it.  This incident reflects my own identity.  When I’m being yelled on I immediately fight back to defend myself, something that most Israeli drivers are doing.
