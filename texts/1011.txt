That somebody throw on my head when I didn't look a big stone, and my head was starting bleeding and there was a lot of blood out of my head and my mother took me to the hospital and a few days after the hospital I got infection in the head and went for a doctor to clean the place. The boy did it because we were fighting and when we stopped I didn't look to his direction and he throw a stone on my head.
