Lately, we hear about a problem of overcrowding in the classrooms.  One solution that has been suggested is that classes be split and taught in two shift, half the class in the morning and the other half in the afternoon.

In my opinion this is very good solution.  I agree to this solution because I think that it solves the problem.

In small class the pupils have more attention and the teacher can listen to every student and to help him.  This thing she can’t do in big class.

On the other hand we can find* disadvantages to the solution.  Most of the pupils want to learn in the morning but only 50 per cent of them will be in the morning.

Another disadvantages is that in a small groups (like the class) we can find people that no one like to be with them.  We don’t want to cause in this kind of situation that one of the pupils will be with no friend.

Finally, I think that the suggestion is very good but we need to make a little changes in it.  If we make the change everyone will be happy with the plan.
