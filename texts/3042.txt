In the morning when I wake up I eat a serieas. for breakfast. In the noon when I came back from school I eat what my mother made for me, sometimes it's scan be spagate with a meat and a salad and sometimes it's can be a mashpotato or fish or even a soup. In the evening I eat a dinner that can be a pizza or a nice piece of cake.
In the BEMAALACH the day sometimes I eat sushi and sometimes I eat fruts.
