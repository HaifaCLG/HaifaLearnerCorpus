One Friday night my friends and I decided to go to Bat-Yam to ice-skate. We drove with a friend of mine who had a driving license. It was raining. When we got near Bat-Yam we made a turn towards the city. A few meters after the turn? Was a huge puddle about 60 meters long, and later we also discovered its depth. After some arguments we decided to try and pass. We drove slowly and carefully, my friend opened the door to see how deep we are, the water was only 2 cm from the door of the car. Suddenly a truck crossed the puddle making waves, and water came into the car.


We drove back and discovered that there is a lot of water in the care, and our feet are soaked. My friend had a cup in his car, so as everyone went out I stayed in the car and scooped the water out with the cup, and I continued pumping while we started driving again to search for another way.


We didn't know another way but we knew that the ice-skating was near the cemetery. So we asked one man on the street "do you know where the cemetery is?", you should have seen his face, he looked at us with a frightened look in his eyes and said :"Good Lord! Straight to the left".


I don't think my writing has changed, but it was nice to have the chance of doing something a bit different.


The most difficult thing was the topics but after I found the right topic there was no problem.


My writing is flowing easily. I don't think writing in English is different than writing in Hebrew, except I have to translate in my mind from English to Hebrew and the opposite.
