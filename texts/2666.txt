The kids in the picture are eating break fast.
They are eating cirial with milk ant they have on the table juice and brid, the mum is in the citchen look out the window, in the citchen they got food and glasses, they got clock and oven,
I think that after every break fast the kids help there mum to wash dishes and go to school.
