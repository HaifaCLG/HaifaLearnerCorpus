My special event with my family is my bat mitzva.
It was two years ago, when I was 12 years old. All the family from parts in the country came to celebrate with me. At first, I made a big party just for friends in club, It was fun and exiting next, I celebreated with my family in a resturant witch was very unusual to see all the family (father, mother, uncel, grandfhater and so all...), sitting together for one night. After a week I travel to Holand, France, Italy and enother places in Eroupe. This is an inventure that I will never forget!!!
