Overcrowding in the classroom is a b big problem that we can't ignore of.

I heard about the solution that were suggested and I have to say that it's the best idea I've ever heard.  It's a good idea because always there is the pupils that can't wake up early in the morning for school, and prefer not to go to school.

From that reason they missed a lot of study material and their grades are low.  If the solution will be accepted by the manager those pupils may choose the second shift at the afternoon and in this way they wonâ€™t miss material.

I hope it will accepted and we all can get to class in time and less drowsy.
