Did you try to come to a football game with your team’s shirt, and sit in the other’s team supporting.  People sits?  I tried

It was a sunny day in September.  I went to a football game with one of my friends and his brother.  The game was against Bnei Yehuda (my team), and Hapoel Tel-Aviv’s crowd, but I wore my team’s shirt, nothing happened until Benei Yehuda scored the first goal, I screamed and all Hapoel Tel-Aviv’s crowd jump on me, I was hurt, and all the game the crowd stared at me.  Do don’t try that at home!!!

My story is very similar to the writer of All American Slurp because she was embarrassed because the people in the restaurant, and in the Gleason’s house were stared at her.  Her family, and I was embarrassed because all the crowd was staring at me in the game, and I was very scared like her.
