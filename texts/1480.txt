One of the most important issues that calls for awareness in Israel is the lack of politeness on the road. This problem is shown by the number of accidents that accrue daily on the roads. The Israeli manner of politeness is seen on different daily issues, such as cutting line lines, using bad language in order to receive service and more. This lack inflicts on the road as well. For example in Europe when a driver blinks his lights to change a lane, he doesn't have to check his mirror because the car on the lane that he wants to Passover to will already have cleared the lane. However, in Israel the second driver would block the lane on purpose, so that the first car can't change lunges. This is just one example to many difficulties of a driver on a road in Israel.

My argument is essentially that politeness on the road can inflict politeness in general, moreover it will reduce car accidents. In just learning to reduced he 'ego' issue from the road, we can solve a lot of tension and anger that an average Israeli has. Understanding that the road is not ours to give or not to give and trying to understand the insignificance of being first in line. These ideas can help, although they have to come from everybody on the road, which makes it all the more difficult. In closing, it is my sincere belief that if we all check ourselves in the front mirror and let the car pass before us, not only will we not lose from it we can gain a lot.
