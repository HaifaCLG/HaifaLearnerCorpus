The telephone rang I ran as fast as I could to the living room and I picked the receiver "Hello"…? The voice said.


"How are you?" I asked, it was my best friend she seemed to be unhappy, "What happened?" I asked but she didn't want to tell me, she said that she would tell me when she comes and she came after a few hours – she was there in my room.


I made us some coffee and we had a long talk, she told me that she had a fight with her parents and her eyes began to be red and she cried. Her parents want her to stop meeting with her boyfriend because her grades in school are not good. She explained to them that it isn't his fault, but she will learn harder but her grades were bad more and more, and they said that I have to leave him and … I love him, I can't live without him. She cried and her tears fell from her cheek "why they don't understand me" she said "why".


I understand you I said but you have to study hard more than ever if you want to see your boyfriend again.


Parents just don't understand as the teenagers they were when they were younger.


I don't understand them at all, they always said that is the teenager problem and that will pass, we grow up with problems and not all of us could solve them.


I would help you, "Would you?" she said. Yes I would "Thanks" she smiled and dried her tears.
