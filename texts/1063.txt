Its five years from now. I'm sitting around with group of fellow soldiers remembering the good old days at school. I say school was really good if I think about it all the boys that looked at me my good friends in class and school. But all the homework, and I remember that everybody I didn't want to go to school, but my mother said Good morning wake up, without power I went to school. The first lesson everybody slept always but after we had a lot of power and energy in the breaks we played around and run on the lawn until the bell rang. We went home after the all day tired from school. But I suppose it could be great to think about the past. It so hard to be in the army and far away from home with a group of fellow soldiers.
I miss my friends some of my friends didn't want to study and everyday they run away from school for some hours and my teachers looked after them. I never run away with them. I loved the summers days with the sun, sitting on the lawn and talking about everything we could I loved the free lessons that we had but there are many things that is bad like the teachers that he always loved us and shouted every lesson but school is good against the army.
