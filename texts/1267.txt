I don't believe that I have finally finished taking all my Bagrut examinations!!!  I feel great!  I'm so happy that I have survived this hard period.

Now I'm calm and relax more that I used to be and I think that I'll stay like this.  I know that there will be harder periods, but after I finished this difficult task â€“ I'm sure that everything will seem easier than it seems before.  And about a celebration.  Usually, I don't like big parties, but no I'm so happy that I want to do a huge party and invite all my friends (that most of them have just finished taking all the Bagrut examinations too) and we will celebrate, laugh and tell jokes until we won't have any power to continue.  I have waited to this moment for such a long time.

I'm the happiest girl in the world.
