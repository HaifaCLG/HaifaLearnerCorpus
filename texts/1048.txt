I will tell you story that happened to me in the school time. It was in 1988 winter, in the morning I came to the kitchen and drank coffee took my sandwich and snatched a gum for the good taste in the mouth. I came to school with the gum in the mouth and forgot to get it out from the mouth to the rubbish pin and the lesson began. it was a physics lessons. The teacher saw that I have a gum in my mouth and she was important and said get out the gum from your mouth to the rubbish pin and if I could I was throwing you to the rubbish pin. During the lesson I did not do anything and I was insulted and I couldn't do with this anything because I told it to my teacher and she laughed and to the manager I did not go because he was too laughing from this. and I didn't forget it until today.
