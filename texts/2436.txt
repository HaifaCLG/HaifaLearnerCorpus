When I was 4 years old befor I go to the kinder garden my mother told to my father there no food at home and they need to go to the super market. But I forget all what my mother said and I told to my GANENET that there is no food at home. She was very woried and she decided to talk with my mother. My mother explain her what happen and then they both laghe.
