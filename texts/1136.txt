One year ago, when I lived in Tel-Aviv, I had a group of friends that were millionaires, we went every day to a restaurant, we bought a lot of clothes, we did a lot of things with our money and we had a big fun.


One day as we went from our house in Dizengoff tower to Dizengoff street to a restaurant we shouted at the cashier, and from that time I didn't see them anymore, and I even wanted my family to go to live in another place, and today we are in Eilat and I have a lot of friends, and they are not snobs.
