My last "Lil Haseder"
The last "Lil Haseder" that was a month ago my family and I celebrated with my mother's side in my uncle's house.
In the event were my grandmother and grandfather, my uncle and ant, the cousins and more people from their side.
For a chance this year we read the "Hagada" in the long virsion. The food was all the raguler things that people eat in Lil Haseder.
I am in scouts so I was surprised to find a winter hat of other tribe because I didn't know that one of my cousins was in scouts and it is a subject that very important and close to me.
Anyway, I wanted this hat because I like to wear things that belonge to scouts but I discovered thata it belonge to there dog!
