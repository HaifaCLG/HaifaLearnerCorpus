I was told to write an article to the school paper about advice to adults.  At first I didn’t really know what to write, but a little thing that happen to me this week convince me that there is a lot to say and a lot to read so let’s get started,

Few days ago I was sitting in my class writing and listening to the things that my teacher says.  She brought to the class not a familiar painting by Mark Shegal but my teacher said that it’s a work of Van Gough and we started arguing.  Then she said:  “I’m bigger and wiser, don’t argue with me please.  So when I come home and search in the Internet information about Shegal and brought it to the class and put it on my teacher’s table.  After she read she understood she was wrong so she came to me and said “Ok Shegal draw this but I think that Van Gough drew it too”.

This was an example for a thing that adults don’t always understand.  We may be kids but we know things too therefore, my first advice to you dear adults, is think before you argue with kids, cause you’re not always right.

My second advice is to know how to say “I’m sorry”.  In my point of view all adults deep deep inside are still kids.  Some of them lost their inner child and maybe that’s the reason that they don’t understand us.  So, if you want to know what we are thinking remember:  “you were a child once don’t lose the child in you listen to him sometimes.

I hope you kids enjoyed my article and the adults.  I hope you’ll use my advice.

Till next time.
