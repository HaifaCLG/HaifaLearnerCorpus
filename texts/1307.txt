In the north of our classroom, stands a small table which has a blue table cloth on it.  The table cloth looks a bit old and has fringes.  On the table there's a silver vase with artificial flowers.  The flowers are bright yellow and very beautiful.  On the right side of the table you can find a butter dish which is small and made of silver.  Right next to it lays a porcelain plate, with some pink napkins on it.  Above this place there's a knife and a small tangerine.  On the left to this plate lays a cup and saucer with a little teaspoon.  Between these two plates there's another tangerine.  Close to the cup and saucer, on the left stands a milk jug which made of porcelain and colored white.
