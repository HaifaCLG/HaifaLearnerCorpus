Last week I was in my brother birthday. All the family came to the party. we were all ate and drank a lot. Only the parents danced.
When my brother walked to the mikrophone he sliped on the floor. we took him to the hospital. He will never forgoten this birthday.
Last year I went with my brother to a soccer game between maccabi haifa as HaPoel tel aviv. That was fantactic game. I am a fan of macabi haifa and they win 4 0. After the game we went to ate Pizza, that was very fun and I want to walk to more game soon.
