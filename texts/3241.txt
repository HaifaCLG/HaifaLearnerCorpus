Dear mike
you wont belive what happened, my grand mother won some kind of a lotery and won alote of money. for my birthday she gave me 4000 shekels.
I was se excited because I now chood afford the sky diving I wanted do bo for so long. the sky diving cost me about 3000 shekels but it was worth it. I had so mutch fun I took many pictures and I made a vidio. I primis to show you next time you will stop bye. I have no clue what am I going to do with the rest of the money, I have a couple of ideas but Im not sure.
maybe I will put them in my saving acout for university in the bank or maybe I will a summer school camp in london or maybe eaven spend it on some close and julery... if you have any idea what I shood do with the money let me know it will help a lote.
with love...
