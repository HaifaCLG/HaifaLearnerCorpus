Dear pupils of parenting school.  Have you ever thought about how your child sees you?  I thought you didn’t.  Your child often sees you as a monster, who is shouting at him with rage.  Sometimes he see you as an angel who mercies him in spite of something wrong he had done.  The question is, how do you want your child to see you?  As a monster or as an angel?  If you want your child to see you as an angel, listen up!

First of all, my advice to you is to love your child.  Studies have shown that loving your child and touching him softly can affect his development of the brain.  A loving child will learn more patiently, knowing that a loving home is waiting for him instead of a cold and cruel home.

However, giving rules for your child is very important too.  A child who grows without rules, will grow up to be a man who can’t obey anyone, therefore he may be unemploy.  More than that, childs like that may use drugs.

In an addition, talk with your child.  Talking to your child can make your relationship much deeper.  Your child will listen to you more and her will care about you more for sure.

From all that you can learn that loving, talking and touching your child is important as giving rules for him and all shall be done in the right amount.
