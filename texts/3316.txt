The picture was taken at school during the break.
The characters in the picture are: the kid that sits alone and listen to music, I believe he likes to be alone. there are two student that plays basketball in yard, and two girls that talk. I don't know about what.
It seems like one teacher is yelling on a young student and he looks shameful.
One guy lay on the ground and plays the guitar and two student read books next to him.
The details that atract our attention are the shoes that hang out of the window and the broken window in the right of the picture.
