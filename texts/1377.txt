When I was 10 years I had a dream the dream was to do a nurse in hospital but my dream don’t come true.

I want to be a nurse because this is very interesting job and I wanted to be a nurse and to be in the ambulance to the hospital but I don’t want to study and somebody want to by a nurse he must study and the study was very very hard for my.

One day I look in the street and I see an ambulance and he took me to the bus station and I so was happy and I love the painting of the ambulance was white and red and I love working with the sick very much.

But when I grow up I dream to be a nurse because then his done .
