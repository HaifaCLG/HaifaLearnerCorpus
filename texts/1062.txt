I remember what happened when I was in tenth grade. Computer didn't learn us we just learned with them it was fun atmosphere at school teachers were human beings we could laugh with them I'll tell you a story about school: one day we went to a movie day with all the grade of school it was eleventh grade when we came to the cinema who was in Tel Aviv our teacher said to us to stay together and no separate. The cinema was in a big mall. So when he start moving to the cinema  a few of us walked from the other side of the mall and we start go on trips and when we saw that they start getting into the cinema we run to them and we get into the cinema with them. When the movie start we all talk between us because that is the fun to sit all the friends together and talk about the movie, and our teacher sat in front of us and he all the time tell us to be quite and when he turned around we continued to laugh on talk and we laugh on him all the time, when we finished to see the movie we were sure that he will complain about us that we all the movie disturb but he didn't complain
