Dear Dudu.
Wazap Dudu? I hope U fine.
I wanted to tell U something exited. Last night my father gave me million $ and said me to do with them what I thing the best.
I couldn't sleep, all night I was thinking what to do and finally I sound some options:
1st give that money to poor peoples.
2nd use it to buy myself a home.
3rd give half to poor peoples and use half to buy the house.
I think I decided the third choise cause it looks like the best thing to do and I wont lose all the money.
If U were me, what would U do?
10q for help me.
your best friend...
