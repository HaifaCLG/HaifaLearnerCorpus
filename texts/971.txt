The thing that interesting me a lot is my hobby karate. I begin to train before two years when I was 13 years old. My system call karate international and we learned many things there. Karate mean the way of life for me and the pupils in the karate learn how to be good people, they learn to think, to be cool to do the right things in the right time, karate do learn his pupils to protect and to help one for another and not to hurt someone. One for four month  we have a test and if we do good test we get one line, after four lines we get a belt we have four belts white green brown and black. I think that I change into his two years I more stability and think before I do something, but I also have a lot to learn this year I start to study to study pupils in the karate and also to learn a theoretical subject about karate. I have a teacher that call master and the club that I trainee their call job. I train six hours in week and I loved that very much we also do something like yoga but its quite different. I want to learn another things that other system teaching, and my system not, because I think that its good to now another things if you can but I never knew it from my sister.
