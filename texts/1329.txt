Before a few years the cellular phone was invented.  From that moment the streets was been filled by many people who using cellular phones.  If you will ask them if they can live a week without their cellular phone I am in doubt if someone will answer “yes”!  And so am I, I can’t live without my cellular phone.  However before the cellular phone was invent, I didn’t notice the fact that he is missing.

When I cam home from school, I spend many hours watching TV, playing the computer, listening to the radio and so on…  In this time, I can do my homework, learn to a text and so on.

In the past, when I got some papers to do for school I need to go to the library and look for the material but now I can check in the Internet and found it in a few minutes, that save me many time and hard work.
