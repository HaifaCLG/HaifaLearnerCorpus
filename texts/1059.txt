In this afternoon when I came home, my daughter came to me with shiny eyes like she cried before and told me that her boyfriend  in the class played with her best friend and he laughed with her and he didn't pay attention to her or talk with her. She didn't know hat happened because yesterday they go around they saw together a movie and she came home very late, but she didn't know what happened or what change his mind. She was very sad. I told her that the world change. There is more elastic, the computers are everywhere but human beings never really change even though they're surrounded by machines. I remember when I was in tenth grade I like very much one boy that like me too. But he didn't like me like I love him. I the beginning we was friends not very close but some times I came to visit him and some times he came to visit me and this happened for long time. One day he came and ask me if I like to go out and we went out we saw a movie and we went to ate pizza. And we have fun. In the end he took me home and we separated with a kiss. All the night I can't sleep and I thought about him and how we will go together the day after in school. In the school in the day after I look for him and when I saw him he was with another girl. His had was around her shoulders and I felt awful.. He didn't pay attention to me or said hello.
This my dear I told to my daughter could never change, the hurt all way still be the same hurt.
