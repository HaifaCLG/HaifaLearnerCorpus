Now it 5 years after if finished school. I am in the army. One night we sat around the bonfire I and some of my friend that was with me at school and talk and experience about school. The good old day that we was at school, we talked about our teachers now we copy in their test, and tell them some things may we wasn't in school that day and something like that. We also talked about the trips that we travel in school in the last class we go to Eilat this trip we remember well. Now we are in the army more big we sat with our girlfriend and talk about the good old days.
