The most difficult thing that teenager have is to grow up and become a big and intelligent man.


Every teenager has his dream to become something when he will be a big man or a parent.


Some want to be in the army or a lawyer or football player …. Not always they succeed in their plan.


Almost everybody become what they are in the time of there in the army they cosh? What to do – not many people choose in school or in college what to do when they grow up.


There is an example – on one guy that I know; now he is in the army he is going to apkit? And if he is going to succeed in the army he is going to sin? And stay in the army as apliket? And if he isn't making it he will go to the university and to become a lawyer.


I think he can be everything he wants to di he is a smart and good teenager.
