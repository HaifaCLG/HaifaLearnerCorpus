Yesterday I want to began and write that letter I rally didn't know about what to write and suddenly 6 friends from my class come and do me surprise because I had a birthday. In school I said to them to come to me but they said that they couldn't. My good friend said she went to her grandmother. Another one said he couldn't come and I had a bad motion because of that. After they came we sat in my room and we have a very good time. They get into my house with 17 balloons and we began to play with them I took a peace of cake and in mistake I put the cake on Gal's face because he was behind me and I get up my arm. So after minute he came and put a peace of cake on my face and we began a cake war. and all my floor were messed. in 11.30 they went way and leave me all the messed in my room, but I really doesn't complain.
