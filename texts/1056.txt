It is 20 years from now. Hi mom, I'm home. I heard my son calling me. Hi I answered. How was your day in school? Just terrible. He answered as he does every day. What was so bad? I wasn't surprised. Everything. On the first lesson, you know gym lesson the one I really love the secretary computer called me to ask me something so I had to leave my computer in the middle of a fascinating basketball game. The secretary computer wanted to know my identity details because it was deleted somehow so I gave her, and while I was walking back to the class, the computer bell rang and I haven't finished the game. I came back to class and I found out that I forgot to turn off the computer. He won the game and also didn't want to work all day. Mom I had to clean up our school yard the whole day. He made a break and I had the chance to say some words. What a shame. And I thought that computers will solve our problems. I guess I was wrong. In my time. Mom, don't start again, Why doesn't he think its interesting. We were playing basket ball, and nothing was deleted from our identity cards  we had no computers and our teachers were so human. Just unbelievable isn't it. But we still had to clean  our school yard. At that time I discovered my son wasn't near me. Probably went to play with his computer.
