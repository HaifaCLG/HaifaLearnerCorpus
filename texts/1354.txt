Israel like the US, is a melting pot for people from all over the world.  There are some ways that new immigrants are accepted into our society.

Sometimes the new immigrants are treated very well.  They get special classes so they can learn Hebrew and they get help of finding jobs.

Sometimes, however, the new immigrants are not treated too well.  Sometimes the society does not care for them and they don’t get help in any way.  In that case they feel very bad here and don’t fit in here.

The children of the immigrants also sometime accepted well in school and sometime they don’t.  Sometime the old kids try to help them at school and try to be their friends and sometime they ignore them or even treat them bad.

To sum up, the way that new immigrants are accepted into our society is in some cases good, but in other cases is not so good.
