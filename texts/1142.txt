My parents are much known in my country â€“ my father is a manager of a bank and my mother writes songs for famous singers, and all the day they are very busy and I have many problems with that.


The first problem is that everybody that hears my family name knows who my parents are and everybody behaves to me like some important man and not like I am in true?


The second problem is that parents are always not at home and I see them only in the nights when I go to sleep. It is true that they give me money and clothes but I don't have something else from them, but no one knows it only me, and everybody thinks that my life is so good, I surrounded by lecturers, and I go with my parents for restaurant and I see all the famous singers but in true I that is boring life.
