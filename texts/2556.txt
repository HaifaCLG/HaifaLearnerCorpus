I always wont a dog. My perents told me that when I get older maybe they will buy a dog. one day when i back from school i saw my mother and my brother with a littel dog. they said that this dog is our dog. I think that it was the best moment in my life! I call her Loona (moon) beacoase she was black and wiyt - wiyt beacoase the moon and black from the night.
