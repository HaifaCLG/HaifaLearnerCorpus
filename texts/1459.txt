Ten years ago, when I was eleven years old, I went to the beach in Tel -Aviv with my family. I remember that I went into the sea. Suddenly there were waves. The waves became bigger and bigger. I felt like I can't get to shore. I started screaming and because of it I began to swallow water, and I choked. I remember that I looked at the shore and I saw all the people and began to scream. But no one could hear me. I began to swallow lots of water. I felt that I'm loosing grip. I started to drawn. I remember that I felt that I don't have power to hold myself above the water anymore. I remember that I told myself thatâ€™s it, it's over, it's the end and I gave up. Slowly I drowned. I remember that an orange rubber boat came towards me. There were two adults in it a boy and a girl. They saved me. They pulled me out of the water. They got me into the boat. They started to talked to me, to ask me if everything is o.k. They brought me back to the shore and they followed me until I found my family. I remember that they spoke to my mother and told her that I almost drowned and that they saved me. My mother thanked them. She asked me if everything is all right and I started to cry. I was so afraid that I would never see her again. It was so frightening.
