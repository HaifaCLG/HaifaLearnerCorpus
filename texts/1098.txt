I could sit and watch him for hours. There aren't enough words to describe him. He was always in my mind. Every were I was, he was with me. I saw his eyes watching me wherever I go. He was in all my dreams. I couldn't picture him with another girl. I wrote his name on any wall, notebook, on my pens. He was so, I can't describe him. I just can't. All I can say is that he is the best movie player I ever saw, and his picture, from a famous magazine, is on my closet. What can I do. I think he'll be always for a dream.
