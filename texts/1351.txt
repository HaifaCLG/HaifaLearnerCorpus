Me and my best friend are having a good time together.  We go shopping together, we study together, we go to parties together.  We are friend for 4 years.  We try to spend time together as long as we can.  My best friend lives in Eilat and studies in my school.  My best friend needs to be funny and smart.  We need to have similar hobbies like dancing, watching TV, playing the computer, go shopping, spend time with friends.  I love talking on the telephone with my best friend because we have a lot of thing in common and we have a lot of thing to talk about.  In short it is very fun to have a best friend.
