It doesn’t have to be so dirty and lame, and it doesn’t even have to be here. Every morning I have to take it with me everywhere, but at the end it’s always standing here. It is eleven pm now, and it’s still standing proud, all smelly and with a bad attitude. It is shinny, and I can almost hear it say: “look at me, I’m still here, you didn’t take me to where I’m supposed to be, so here I am, standing in front of your face all day long- I’m a constant reminder of your laziness, aren’t I?” I know it’ll keep standing here until I take care of it as I should, but why can’t I do it now? It’s standing right at the edge of my desk threatening to fall off, so that I’ll notice it better. Its round shape doesn’t sooth my eye. It has a bright red lipstick stain right next to its well shaped handle. The handle is the only thing I like about it, because it’s almost as if it doesn’t belong there. It’s very small, so I can almost circle it with my palm, and it is also deep and wide enough for my fist to fit in. The see-through, stained glass is only half empty, and inside it there’s still cold coffee I didn’t finish drinking this morning. I remember being in a hurry, so I probably didn’t pay any attention to the mess I left behind.

The thing is that now I have to take it to the kitchen, and in the kitchen there is a pile of dishes I didn’t wash from the last three days. This filthy annoying glass just keeps reminding me of my duties, and that is probably why I hate it so much.
