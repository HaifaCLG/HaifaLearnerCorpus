Today, Tom and Maya's mother took a vacation and she had a day with her children.
She bought a bread and milk and made a salad and now the children went to eat. At 10 clock they will go out for a trip. At the moment the kids are sitting near the table and their mother is cleaning the house. She is baking cookies and Macarony. She put flowers on the window of the kitchen and washed the dishes.
I think that Tom and Maya do that every morning and at the end go to school.
