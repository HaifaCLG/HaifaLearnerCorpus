Our life is full of many opposites, as much as a coin.  A coin has two sides which every single side differs from the other and expresses different concepts.  It’s similar to “ambition”.

“Ambition” has many positive and affirmative aspects under these circumstances, it will enable us to achieve our intents, carry out our targets and fulfil our dreams.

Furthermore, “ambition” had the capability to encourage us to invest our time and efforts in constructing our society in order to lead it to development and unceasing progress.

Moreover, being ambitious and fulfilling our dreams will give us favourable feelings, satisfaction and a state of feeling pleased or contented which will help us to upgrade our life.

On the contrary, “ambition” might be gathered with negative phenomenon which are repressive forces.

One of these phenomena is running after the success and to turn to something which is full of negative meanings.

Another phenomenon is neglecting life with all of her significance that carries to human beings and concentrate in achieving our ambition in life.

In summary “ambition” might be a good thing as much as a bad thing.  We are responsible for this, it means we should take the positive aspects in ambition and manage with them in life and take care from the other side of “ambition” which will drive us to madness for many consequential things in our life.
