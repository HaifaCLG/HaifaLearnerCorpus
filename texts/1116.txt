The most exciting thing that ever happened to me:
When I first got into recording studio in Tel-Aviv, where all the famous singers in Israel are recording their songs, their albums. Me, and more 17 boys and girls of my group (from Petach-Tikva) went to record our songs. We've been working on a new show for six months and we had to record 10 songs of it. It was a great experience. I felt really important to stand and sing with he phones on my ears, to repeat every line again and again, till I'll get the best thing.
Two days – 12 hours each – we were all tired. We worked really hard but it was worth it. We were treated very nicely and we had a lot of fun. Now I have the cassette of "Pikud Melabes" (The name of the group) and I can give it to people who always ask me for information about this group.
