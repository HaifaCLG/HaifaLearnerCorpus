When I had 12 my parents wanted to celebrate my bat mitzva. My parents did all the hard stuff: called to a DG and had to find where we will celebrate and helped me to find a pretty dress and a nice shoes and of course to do something with my hair. My parents and my sister had to dress nice too. In the bat mitzva many people came: friends, family... and everyone said to my only good things about me. The food was delicious and everyone danced. The music was great and the DG ask me to sing and I sang.
At first I was nervous and I couldn't sing normally but in the second song it was better.
