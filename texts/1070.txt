It was 3 o clock the sun started to shining we sat in our comp. I start talking. You know my brother start to study in 5 hours from now I would woke to be in bed now and to start leaning. You know school was really not bad it was fun to be in school. When I'm looking at the past it has very easy there but of course there were some bad points like when we had to study very much to test, and when we had to run to the bus every time. But when we with friend and laugh a lot and be at home every day that was a lovely life. All that things I told to my friend who sat near to me in one breath and when I looked at him he just slept and didn't listen to me.
