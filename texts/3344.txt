The family event that I would like to talk about i passover.
Our last passover was at my uncle's heus in Tzipori. The man who was in charge of the evening was a crazy old man which isnt really relted to me. He was very funny because he made a lot of mistakes with is reading and behavior in general. But generally this passover was great because I got to see my cousins.
