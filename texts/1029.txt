When I was a little boy I was walking in the street and I saw a space ship. It was very beautiful to saw that. It was very big and in the pace ship were many people that them saw like animals. There were animals of all the kinds. There were a elephant, a lion, monkey. I didn't know how them could to flew the space ship. Who was the animal that knew how to held the steering wheel. When I saw them I was very scar about our village. I did know what them wanted to did. Maybe them wanted to kill our people in the village. After a day I went to the area that the space was there and I found it. I looked for the space carefully that them didn't see my because my father told me that if them saw me them could kill me. After another day I went to there and the space ship was not there. And all the people were very happy and now them could to live a good life.
