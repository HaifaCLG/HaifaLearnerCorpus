Hello Nohum
two days ago it was my birthday I had a party and it was so much fun to bad you couldn't come.
After the party I open my present and guess waht? I got a 500 nis from my mom and dad!
I was so happy when I saw the money.
But now I'm dont know what to buy with it.
Im thining to buy a new dvd player to my room and then I could watch movie in my bed it could be so cool!
But on the other hand I could buy some new games for my computer, and you could come and we will play together.
I'm thinking I will go on the dvd player because I got some game I can play, but a dvd player can be very helpful, and I wont a dvd player in my room for a long time and finlley I can buy it.
After I will buy it you will be able to come to me and watch some cool movies.
your friend...
