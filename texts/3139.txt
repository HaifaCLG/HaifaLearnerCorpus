Hello Noga,
In my birthday I'v got from all my family 1000 shekels. it is a a lot of money! but I decided that I want to go to a dance cours in the summer and it is cost a lot money. so to help my mother to pay that I save my money and continue to save.
what do you think? maybe I need to have fun and spend the money? or maybe it is a nice thing to help my mother.
thank you
