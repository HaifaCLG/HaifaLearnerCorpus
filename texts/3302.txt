My family made surpprise party to the uncle of my mom.
All the family came, and I was very excited to see them.
Some of them I never see, and I don't know what are they.
When the uncle came to the place of the party there was silence and no one scream suprise or mazal tov, it was very immbarassed. But after she came, every one kissed her. They read for her. Everything was fun. After the party I and my family talked about the party all the way home.
To sum up was very fun.
