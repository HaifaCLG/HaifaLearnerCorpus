Dear Nofar, How are you?
yesterday I had a bearthday. my family gave me 3,000 shakel. Tomorrow I will go with my brother to buy "laptop". If I don't spend all the mony, I will buy for me a little dog. I love animals like dogs.
I want computer because my friend has and I want too.
First I decided to buy PM3 but in the end I decided didn't buy. If you had this mony what will you buy? give me some exampal what to buy.
see you soon...
