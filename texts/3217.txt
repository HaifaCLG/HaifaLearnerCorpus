Hi Ron
Its my birthday today, like you know, and my parents gave me an hour ago, 10,000 shekels, for my only 14 birthday. I am so exite now, I can't wait to spend it, but I dont know on what I can buy a Xbox, Sony, som basket to my garden, or a new computer but I most want a Xbox. I will tell you when I will buy somthing.
