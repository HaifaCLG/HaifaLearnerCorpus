Overcrowding in the classroom is a problem in many schools today.  One solution that has been suggested is that classes be split and taught in two shifts, half the class in the morning and the other half in the afternoon.  This change has advantages but also disadvantages.  For example, one advantage is, of course, less overcrowding.  When the class will be split, half of the pupils won't even be in the class or in school when the other half will study there.  Second, the noise in the class will not be as loud as before because the numbers of the pupils won't be the same so there are less pupils that talk with the teacher.

On the other hand there are a lot of disadvantages too.  The friendships between the two halves of the pupils won't be the same.  Both halves won't see half of their friends in school.  Friendships can be over this way.  Also, some of them won't like this idea of splitting the class will object and this can cause difficulty in arranging the two halves of the class.  In my opinion, the friendship between the pupil is more important than anything else.  That is why I disagree to split the classes.
