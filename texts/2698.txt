My Dinner...
Last month I was 15 years old, so all my family came to my house for dinner.
My aunt brought me a gift and I was surprised. I open the gift and it was a fotball. everybody ate dinner, and I played with the new ball.
My father managed the event and everybody were happy
The music was old - from 1990 but I loved it.
The food was delicious, and dinner was done very fast.
whan we finished to eat we started to clean the table and some glasses were felt, I was surprised and everybody shocked, but when they so what happened they relexed.
