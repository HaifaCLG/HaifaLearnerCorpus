I was sitting at my office, thinking, while I was waiting for the next customer, that had to come in a few minutes.  I thought a lot myself, and how I got to the successful woman that I today.  I’m only 30 years old, but I managed to learn at Italy, in Rome interior decorate.  After 3 years, when I was 24 years old, I opened an office of my own, and started to decorate, at my customers houses.  My name, as a good interior decorator, became famous, and after 6 years I achieved a high place between the decorators in Israel, and I even got some work in Europe.  Of course I had earned a lot of money, and I live today, comfortably, in a nice penthouse.

My thoughts cut of when my secretary, Amir, called me, and said that a man came, and said that he want to meet me, because he needs an interior decorator, and he heard about me.  He hadn’t asked for it before, like people used to, when they needed me, but the one that asked for meeting hadn’t come, so I let that man to get in.

When he opened the door, I shocked!  I couldn’t believe it’s true.  I never though I’ll see him again, he was the boy that I loved at high school and I have never forgot him.  He cam in, with a smile, and said:  “I see that you remember, I also couldn’t forget, and when I heard about you, I couldn’t stop myself, and came to see you, at that moment I felt that all my dreams come true.
