One of the celebrations in my life was the first day at school, My first school was Name I lerned there one year (first grade) and then I moved to other school named Dganim, I learned there 5 years (untill 6th grade) and now I learn at middle school at 7th grade. When I was of first grade I though that it's fun to learn at school, But now I realized that it's no so fun!!!
