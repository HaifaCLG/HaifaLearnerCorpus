Noam, I got EINSOF $ for my birthday. You can't belive what I can buy now. I think i'm about to sparke kind amount of money.
I think i'm gonna buy a "Logitech G5 / MX 518 optical computer mouse, and a "Razzer" Tarantulla keyboard. These equipment are for proffesional gamers. they're not cheap at all.
