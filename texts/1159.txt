Violence has been an important issue on our public agenda for quite some time now.  We hear more and more about violent incidents at home, school and on the streets.  Violence involves and affects different aspects of our life.  Today, I would like to focus on two that I find the most significant ones.  The most obvious aspect is the direct physical and emotional damage it causes, which brings us to wonder how and why violent behaviour occurred.  Another aspect raises moral questions about the direction that this society is heading for, and what so much violence in one society tells us about the individuals that are part of it.  In this article I intend to discuss those questions.
