Me and my parents traveled to USA last year.
the trip was for my 13 barthday - bar Mizzva.
we were in NY., LA. Vegas, san franssisco and more. we saw a lot of places and view.
we stayed ther about two month.
not every child have that luck to visit the big USA in that age.
we prepare for that trip somethign like about six month.
was very fun.
