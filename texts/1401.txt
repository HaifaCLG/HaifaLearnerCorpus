My name is irit katz and I study English to be a teacher. I am almost twice as old as the other students in my class since this is change in my career. Previously I worked in hotels. I enjoy my studies and my mates and very happy for this opportunity I have to study at this stage of my life. My hobbies are reading and music. I love all kinds of music and I like to hear music whenever I can.

As I have tried to study English at the university twice before, I can compare the college I'm in today to Tel-Aviv University and to Johannesburg University in South-Africa. I must admit that learning in this college is far better for me. I think part of it is due to the fact that I like close supervision and to be known by my name. at the university the classes can be of 150 students and most of teaching is done in frontal lectures and teachers use microphones in order to be hared.

I am willing to talk about philosophy, nature, alternative medical etc.

I have tried meditation and found it very relaxing, but I don't do it regularly as I am to lazy to wake up at down which supposed to be the best time for it.

About four years ago I went to a  field school in the desert (the Negev) and practiced meditation for ten days in a row. It was an assume experience which I'll never forget as I was fortunate enough to have an exterritorial body experience, in which I succeeded in eliminate feeling any physical body mass and could only feel the action of breathing.

That is to say, although I knew I'm sitting on a cushion on the floor I could not feel my legs or my arms or anything, but the air going in and out my nostrils.

This was a unique one time experience. And I would have liked to know if you experienced anything like this.
