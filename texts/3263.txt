Last year I and my family were invited to a bat mizzva of a daughter of my father's sister.
This bat mizzva was in Jerusalem and my Parents had taken a day off from their's work and started to get ready, I and my sister didn't go to school that day, something that made her very pleased. the first thing we had done before we start to proper was to bay a present that will make them happy and show them they are very important to us, althougth we live far away from each oter and had been spoken of almost tree years over the phone. When we got there a tried to really cath up with them, and we told each other what we have been though. when we had to leave I decided to keep in touch with that side of my family.
