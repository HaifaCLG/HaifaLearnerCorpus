I read you newspaper two days ago and I saw this interesting article.  The article talked about the Israelâ€™s top 10 priorities for educating its children.

As a teenage and a student in the educational system, I feel that the Israelis highest priority for education should be enabling the children without the suitable economic abilities to take part in the society.

This can be done by a day-care observation.  Also it must be more than one teacher in a class, that all the children can get the highest marks that they can get.

As you probably know it is very hard to find children with social issue.  Therefore I recommend that the parents and teachers will be more in touch about their child.

Thank you for your time.
