I think that in the 21st century the schools will be more computerized but the teacher will be human they will use the machines to help pupils that wouldn't understand something. A computer also can explain things more interest than human. The computers will also check the tests. In the end computers will take the place of human also in teaching. I don't think that the pupils will want to be in school like today because today it is hard to learn and if you don't understand  something you have to hire a private teacher. The computer teacher would be programmed friendly and every pupil will go on his level. In the everybody will learn the same things. The pupils will learn very little literature because it is an unimportant subject and more about biology and science. The pupils that would have a computer in their homes will also learn in their home. After this I think that the scientists will invent a machine that transfer automatically all the knowledge to their minds of the children and after this they can play until they want.
