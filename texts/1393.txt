Many many years ago I had a dream.  At time I thought it was a wonderful dream.  I was dreaming about having a big house or even a palace.  I thought about a pool outside the palace.  About my cars, big cars.  I thought about many beautiful women who will want to date me and get married if Iâ€™ll will be rich.

After 7 years my dream came true.   We were a poor family.  I was playing many games like Toto and Lotto in hope to win a large prize and to get rich.  Well I have never won no prize and I realised that getting rich is not so easy and I will have to work hard to get rich.  Well I worked hard I worked very hard.  I was working in a company.  A computer company.  In short I was only a clerk but I was working very hard for a long time and in 14 years I became the manager of it company.  I earns a lot of money each month and in 5 or 6 years I became a very rich men.  When I saw my dream come true I want to make the dream perfect.  Then I built a pool and bought many cars.  And I dated many beautiful women until I married your mother.  At the beginning I was very happy I saw my dream come true.  But after 3 year of marriage I saw that the dream is not so good I have a breakdown because I worked to hard.  Your mother and I had many fights and we still fight as you know it.  I had to keep work very hard because if I stopped working the whole company would bankrupt.  Now many years after I got rich I thing that I would liked being poor or starving then rich because rich in my opinion have money problems more than poor people they have rich problems.
