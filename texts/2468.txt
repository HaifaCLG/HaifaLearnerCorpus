Last summer I celebrated my bat mitzva in Italy. I flew to Italy with my family to two weeks. In the first week I was in Rome and I saw many important places like: the kolsiom, pontana de treri and mroe.
Rome is a old city and if you go on the streets you can see many old homes.
In the second week I was in Tornto - a city on the sud of I taly. I enjoyed from the beach and from the beutiful view.
The trip was very fun!
I ate there spagat, pizza, and ice cream -
It was very delicious.
