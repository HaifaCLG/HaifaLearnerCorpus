When I was a little girl, I went to my aunt and uncle, they were living in an apartment building, I was very young and I went with my dad, I was shore that I know the way up and I started to walk up the stairs when suddenly I didn't see my dad, I kept walking up the stairs, looking for my aunt and uncle's department but I couldn't find it. Then I decided to ask for help, but nobody beside me was there, I went to one of the doors and knocked, when the door was open and a man was standing in front of me, I asked for help, at last I have found the house, when I came inside and saw my dad I started to cry, my dad though I was already inside the house and didn't worry to my, this experience looked very frightening when I was young.
