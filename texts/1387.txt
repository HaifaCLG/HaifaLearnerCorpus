I don’t live near Arab village but our country is little and I have a friend live near Arab village.  And my fiend told my some story  that his family’s experience because the hatred between the Jews and the Arabs.  His father went to nearby village Arab to take work’s  to the village to work.

Went he go there somebody throw on his car Molotov bottle.  To his father not happened nothing but the car is destroyed.

The argument Palestine Jews about Israel country start many year before.

In 1948 then the Jews have a country – Israel.

The Palestine in Israel tell that Israel isn’t for the Jews he is for the Palestine.

Then have the war for independence then the Jews win.  Many Palestine move to Jordan – and they know they come again.  The Palestine they stay in Israel live in Hebron, Shehem, Bet Letterm and other cities.

After war six day Israel take the cities of Palestine and the had an argument was hard.

Today after Twenty-two years from war six day – we have the antifada like a year.  The Palestine feel depress and they won’t have country in territories and after system like yesterday 8.2.89.  Driver taxi went home in the road someone (Palestine) take a Molotov bottle – the taxi burnt and the man kill have many other Molotov bottle.

To the argument Palestine Jews I don’t see a solution because the Palestine have their ideas and they want to have are the Jews have here a place and they want to stay  too.

The friend’s brother and his friend drive in the car suddenly are men stop them and he take knife and stabbed in his face.  This situation was in the newspaper.
