About 3.5 years ago, the summer holiday was at the beginning, I and my family, were sitting in the kitchen. Suddenly my father asked me if I would like to flew to Europe this summer. I really wanted it, and of course I said yes. Then he took out five tickets and told me that this summer we would fly all the family to three countries: Holland, Belgium and France. I was very happy, and waited for it expectantly. The trip was sixteen days and I learnt and enjoyed a lot. A year later we flew again to Europe, but this time to German and Austria, I also enjoyed this trip, but I found the people in Holland kinder. That was my last trip, but I want at the age of 18 to visit in the far east.
