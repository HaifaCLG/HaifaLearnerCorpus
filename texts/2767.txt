Yesterday was my birth day and two days ago was my birtd day party. IN the party, I got a lot of presents and money. My uncle gave me more money than everyone else. In fact, I think he gave me so much money because he loves me. After the party when I got home, I started to count the money. I had 5,000$ and I was thinking abut buying a new computer with the money but my mom didn't want me to. "you dont need a new computer, your old one is fine" she said. I obviously didnt think so. I couldn't get a new computer without my mom notecing it and since I couldn't convince her to let me get one, I gave the idea up/ I didnt have anything to buy with my money so my mom deposited it in the bank.
If you ask me its a waste but my mom saies that I will need the money when I will get older.
