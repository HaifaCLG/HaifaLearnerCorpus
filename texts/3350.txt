It was my aunt's wedding, she was dressed beautiful. She looked pefect, it was the happiest day of her life. The music was great and the songs were reallky popular. My family was very excited, even more than my aunt. Some of my friends arrived and that's why I enjoyed the wedding.
I had fun, I enjoyed the food and the dancing.
My grandma was super nervous, she wanted everything to be perfect.
The place looked amazing I bet it was expensive.
The event was great and enjoyable.
