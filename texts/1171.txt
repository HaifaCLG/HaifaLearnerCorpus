I think that we should give the territories back.


I think that we don’t and how you get that idea to give our territories back?


Because if we give back the territories we finally can have some peace in our country.


I don’t think that it will work, I think that our people will always suffer from the Arabs and no matter what we try to do they will always be around us.


But we can try!  You never know if you don’t try to find out.


Well I don’t know, but all I know that it’s our territories and it’s our past, our soldiers fought for this territory and it’s ours.


I guess you are right.


I know that I’m right, and I hope that our god will help us.


I know that god will help us.  I know that for sure.



I don’t think that it was a good idea to give back the territories because our soldiers they fight for this territory and many were died.


These cities are part of our history and  part of our religion and part of us and our cultures.  I will very hope that our territories stay ours like they should.
