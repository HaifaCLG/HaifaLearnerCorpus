Yesterday me and my sister were playing in the living room. Suddenly was an electricity stopped. We took some candles to make some light and we put them at a plate on the rug. While we were playing suddenly I heard a very strange noise coming from my sister side. I looked at her and I saw that her here was catch on fire. I got so frighten that I thro0w my book over her had. But she wasn't afraid, she start laughing and I laugh too. My big brother came to the living room and when we told him about the here that catch on fire he start telling us about the danger that we could do if I wouldn't throw the book and put out the fire. No we will never put candles at a place that can be dangerous for us and for our house.
