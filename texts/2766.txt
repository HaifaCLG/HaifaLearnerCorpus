Yesterday I was in my brother's wedding party. When I arrived, I saw my brother with his wife dancing. When he noticed me he stopped dancing and we all congratulated him. After a few hours, the entire place was full of people waiting to see the newly married caple everyone I know was there. My parents, my grandparents, my brothers friends and the brides relatives. The music was traditional and the food was great. It was the most exciting thing I have ever been in.
