Hey Omri, how are you?
A week ago I had a birthday. i was 14 years old.
yesterday I went to my grandmother and my grnfather.
and they gave me money.
when I opened the box I was very surprised.
There was 1000$.
I don't know what I going to do with the money
I think that I will go to the mall and spend all the money...
What?! I need clothes
When is your birthday?
write me back...
