Hi Yosi,
How are you feeling?
I'm fine because I've gotten a lot of money for my birthday.
It was for my 16 birthday party, and I don't really know what to do, I think about buy a new guitar an acustic one because I have classic one and I want to improve my self and my playing in giutar, also because I love the sound of this guitar.
If I will not buy a new guitar, I can buy a new computer, a great computer with great performance.
I don't know out I have to chek prices, and then choose what I want to buy. give me advice,
what do you think that I should bay?
thank you my freind...
