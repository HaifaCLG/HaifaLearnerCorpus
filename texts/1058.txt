It’s the last year at the elementary school – 6th grade. My friend have planned to rob the material store room its where the school keeps the materials for carpentry lesson. About a month before the big holiday started an accident occurred a ball was kicked and broke the window of the material room I made a round hole by the size of a ball. The fixing of the window was carried on and on. The last day before the holiday it was still not fixed. My friend and I planned everything like what we'll do if we hear somebody coming when we're inside how to get in and out and so on. The day had come. We were in school by the broken window. I climbed up the window, got my had through the hook, carefully I opened the lock we opened the windows we climbed in. It was all with in a hand reach we just had to take what we wanted and go, but something prevented us from taking anything we took some tapes and ran away.
