I am interesting in Adam the singer. I live his song, his voice. When I Adam's cassette arrived to the store I bought the cassette. I have 2 cassettes. His song are very beautiful some of them are quiet and some of them no so quiet. The word of his song very beautiful, some of them sad most of them sad. In the later summer I went to Adam show it was in Akko I went with my 2 friends we shout and jump we shout Adam, we sang together with Adam. It was a nice show. He song most of his songs. After this show I saw Adam more 3 times in different place. A very time that I heard his voice from t.v. or radio I am very happy.
