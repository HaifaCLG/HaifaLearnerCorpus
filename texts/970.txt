I'm girl that fell in love with a man 21 years old. I forgot to tell you that I am 16 years old. I met him in my vacation in Hanuka. We worked together about a week. During the week he always said that I'm sweet and we talked about everything that we could we pay compliment one to each other. After that week we stopped this contact. I met him in the street one day  and we talked a daily talking. I felt that he don't want to talk with me. His friend came and he turned around and stopped talking with me. I stood there like a dumb so I said, good bye. and I want with a broken heart. I met him again the party all the evening I danced with my friend  and he with his friends. He didn't come to say to me hello. I passed over next to him, I turned around laughed a forced laugh and went anther time with a broken heart.
