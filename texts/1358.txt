Israel is a “melting pot”, accept people (immigrants) from all over the world.  Most of the immigrants that come to Israel are from Russia.  Usually they come in small group that relative one of each other.

When the immigrants arrived to Israel, Tel-Aviv airport, most of them stay there and a minority move to other places, like the kibbutz.  In the kibbutz the immigrants learn to share, cook and how to live together.  And after some time when they feel ready, they usually move to big cities like: Tel-Aviv, Haifa, Eilat, etc.

The immigrants that came to Eilat get a lot of benefit from the city hall, for living in the city, they get help in finding a place to live and for finding a job.

Finally, they can set down and live their life.
