Being a teenager is hard. Your thoughts are so weird that everyone that sits next to you becomes as weird as you are. Your thoughts are not so fixed right, and you usually can't decide for yourself (that's why we've got parents).


For example, one day I was walking down the street thinking about life, the meaning, and the book I've just read.


Well, this guy just came out of the bank with money in his pockets, and then he approached me and said if you'll call a cab for me, we'll split it 50-50.


At that time I was about the meaning and couldn't get any idea about his ideas so I continued walking and the next I read in the newspaper about that guy and that he had a lot of money (no numbers were given).


I guess that's nothing comparing to another thing that happened to me. In the ninth class I walked near the girls W.C. (I have no time to explain) and our principal called me (I was the tallest guy there) and ordered me to get inside (!) and unblock a stall that was locked from the inside. Of course I said no but he insisted and I couldn't refuse. I entered the W.C. with my nose in my hand and kicked on the door from behind me. A group of people encouraged me to go deeper, I continued ….. Unreadable        and passed out.


The moral is (is there) that teenager's life are full of excitement – please don't make jumpy – he's already?
