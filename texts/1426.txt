Watching a wild animal locked in a cage is like a contradiction in terms. When I consider the term wild, I instantly imagine vast lands, endless horizons and untamed beauty. The trembling body of a cheetah after a wild chase at a speed of a 100 km per hour, right before it places its prey under a bush, so it can indulge on it safely and quietly, is one sight you will never catch in a zoo. I would like to add my voice to those who argue that zoos are inhuman. That keeping animals in captivity is, in fact, wrong. Zoos deprive animals from their basic right for freedom and in the long run, put them in danger of extinction.


Living in a zoo means a life of imprisonment to any wild creature. Even the largest best maintained zoo could never compare to the natural habitat of a wild animal of any sort. While in the wild, many animals such as wolfs, monkeys or elephants mainly live in large groups formed throughout many generations, in the zoos they are often kept in solitary, deprived from their basic need to socialize with their own kind. Being locked up in an often-confined cage does not allow most animals, especially large breeds such as gorillas or tigers, to engage in any form of exercise or to enjoy a real freedom of movement.


Another consideration is procreation. Some animals, such as elephants, just barely succeed in procreating away from their natural habitats. In many cases they are sentenced for a life of sterility. Even if a female elephant does succeed in getting pregnant, most chances are she will not be able to take care of her cub on her own, so they probably face the fate of separation.


In conclusion, keeping wild animals captive is ignoring some of their fundamental rights as living creatures such as freedom of movement and the ability to procreate and therefore is extremely wrong.
