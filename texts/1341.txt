Dear parent, I want to talk to you as your child and explain to you what we, the teenagers, think about your acting.  And, who knows maybe at the end we will find a solution.

First, and it’s for sure – all of us hate that you ask to clean the room.  I hate that my parents ask that – I’m sure that your children too.  So now I ask you, stop!  If for us it’s not bad, what is your problem with that?

The second thing that we don’t like.  It’s that all the time you want us to do our homework.  You must trust us and believe us when we say that we will do it later.

However, we can’t say that we don’t love you because it will be a lie.  We love you very much but you must try to understand us.

So now, at the end, I hope that I help you and you feel better.  It was nice to explain what we, the children, think.
