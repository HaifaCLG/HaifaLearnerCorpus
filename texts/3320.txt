The event that I chose is my bar mitzva. We celebrated in our house. my mother made food and we cleaned the house for it. There was few family members and close friends. I really had fun and I got some presents. My mother took care about everything and I was really sad when the CD player didn't play my music. I also got 10,000$ from my grandfather. The event was normal but sometimes funny.
