It was an experiment I was going to be – injected? To a human body.  It was since and they asked for volunteers so I volunteered.


It was exciting day I was a little afraid but I go to the laboratory of experiment.


When I got there they put me in a space ship so I can be protected when they changed me to a little man.


When I over this condition I was little the condition was little bit hard but I survive? After him. They put me in an injection and injected me to a human body – it was moving and a little bit frightening.


I start moving in the body I went to the heart? And I went to the all body. After a whole day that I was been in the human body I come out when the man that I was in his body snise?


It was an exciting day I wish that everybody will know him.


It was a great experience I study a lot also they were time that doing composition was "sick and tired to me" but it was exciting.
