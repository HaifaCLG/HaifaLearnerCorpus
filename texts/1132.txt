It was in the summer. I was on a trip – he was younger from me in a year. He learned in my school, on that trip I met him first and we had a beautiful relationship. The end of the summer came and we had to go to school again. I was very happy to see him again and I think that I fell in love with him.


But in school he had his own friends and I had mine – we didn't meet much, but in trips we were together all the time.


I wanted to be his girlfriend, but we were afraid from what will the friends think about us. So we were just good friends, and I didn't want only this relationship. I wanted much more from that. He was very tall and very beautiful. I can remember him until today, ten years later.


To my children I will say don't listen what the people talk. Do what you want to. If not you will lose something or someone you love.
