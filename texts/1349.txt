Dear parents, I want to tell you some advice that will help you with your kids.  I’m also a child and I want to help you from a kid’s point of view.

My first advice the most important one, is to always tell your children that you love them, and that they mean a lot to you.  Children love it.

My second advice is when your children make a mistake, don’t yell at them, talk with them, explain them that what they did is wrong and tell them you will always be there for them.

The third and last advice is do not tell them to organize their room because it’s annoying and they will think that you don’t trust them, a thing that kids don’t like.

Finally, give your children a lot of attention and the relationship between you will be good.
