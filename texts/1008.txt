It was two years ago. It was night. and I was alone with my little brother. The house was empty of noise. I was watching t.v. at the moment my brother was playing with his stuff. Suddenly it was dark. I ran out to see what was happened. It was fuse and I could fix it but when I got in the house again I smell a smoke. I went to the kitchen to see what was happen it wasn't in the kitchen. I went back to the t.v. to watch it but I was a black smoke came out of the t.v. I was very scared, and my brother started to cry. I switch off the t.v. for a moment and took my brother after a half and hour I switch on the t.v. again but the black smoke came again. I thought that the house will burn out and then my parents came and phoned the mechanic  of the t.v. In that night I didn't get to sleep because of fearing.
