I’ve waited for this moment my entire adolescence.  I finally finished taking all my Bagrut examinations and I can’t hardly begin to describe how I feel.  To me finishing my examinations means to move to the next level in my life.  I’m not a teenager anymore now I’m an adult!  From now on my life will definitely change, no one will treat me like a little girl anymore.  People will start to take me seriously, because I proved myself and took all my Bagrut examinations and hopefully I’ll pass them too.

Well now, when the big day has finally arrived I am planning on a big celebration.  I think about going abroad or maybe a big party for all my friends.  No matter what it will be a party or a trip or maybe both of them.  I guess I’ll have to wait until my exam results arrives because the maths are all that really matters.
