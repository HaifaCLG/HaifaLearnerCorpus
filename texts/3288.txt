Dear friend,
Hi how are you?
Last month I had a birthday and I got some money.
My grandmother gave me 500 shekels nad I bought clothes and shoes for Shavuot.
My friends gave me 200 shekels and we hung up together with it.
I got more money from my parents too and thier friends. maybe next week I will go shoping with it and buy all the things I need, but I want to visit Eiylat in summer with my friend too.
I think I will give up about the idea of Eylat for now because I need a lot of stuff and I don't want to take from my parents more money.
what would you do?
Write to me...
