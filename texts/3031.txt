Hi mike!
what up? what are you doing in the summer?
me? I had the time of my life!
before one week I threw an awsome birthday party and I got much more money than I exepted.
its somthing like 5 hundred shekels (includs family).
untill now I bought alot of clothes and I went to a cool movie.
but I think to buy myself an electric guitar.
I play almost one year and I think its the time!
so maybe I'll come visit you in tel aviv when I'll be there to buy the guitar in more ten days.
and one more question what would you buy if you has 5000 shekels?
miss you alot
