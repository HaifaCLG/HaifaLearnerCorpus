The first article I would like to talk about belongs to Da-Wa Chung, Korean aging society. As a person that steel has not got to Korea yet, I found the article very interesting and surprising. My lack of knowledge about Korea is quite big, the information given in the article was very unknown for me. The article was quite small but it got straight to the point and it explained very clearly this awkward problem of aging society in Korea. The structure of the article is well built, so it makes it very clear and easy to understand. Last thing I would like to say is that I really like the way of  how Korean look at elder people with a certain admiration, or with the perception of thinking that old people can still be effective because of their long life experience.





It is great fun and satisfaction to read such a lovely and liberal article, specially in this specific sensitive topic. I totally agree with Riika, it is so sad that the Netherlands is still the only country that permits assisted suicide (if I am not wrong), I guess that the big majorities of people in Europe are in favor for it but it seems that the religious influences prevent from us such logical things. I loved the article, it is very convincing and it is enough to read the perfect example that compares us, humans, to our pets that are taken to the veterinary. I think I will use this example whenever I will have a discussion about this important and burning issue.





It is good to hear someone raising his voice for rescuing poor suffering people in poor countries that suffer from natureâ€™s disasters. I think the article is quite interesting but it has few structural mistakes and few spelling mistakes that have to be changed in order to make the article even better.
