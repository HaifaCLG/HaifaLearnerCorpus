Diabetes is a huge and growing killer, and became very popular among adults. People can get diabetes at any age and its very dangerous and risky.


Our blood always has some glucose in it because our body needs glucose for energy, but too much glucose in the blood isn't good for our health, diabetes is when glucose is very high.


Our blood glucose level gets high when the insulin (hormone made in the pancreas; this hormone helps the glucose from food to get into our cells) doesn’t work the way it should, then the glucose stays in our blood and cause diabetes.



Both women and men with diabetes are at risk.

I have many relatives who suffer from diabetes, I can watch the differences in their lives’ routine, their lives are not the same any more, they have become looking and feeling older, most of them start to wear glasses, all of them have many diseases, some of them become very thin and the others are fat  (they have difficulties losing weight) .

After many years, diabetes can cause problems in our eyes, kidneys, nerves, teeth and heart disease.



You can reduce your risk of developing heart disease by controlling your blood pressure and blood fat levels.



In addition people who have diabetes should add a physical activity to their daily routines, which can low the risk of having heart attack.


Remember that every step toward your goals helps!
