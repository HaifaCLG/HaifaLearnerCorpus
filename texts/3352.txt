Dear Natalie,
Last month I got 10,000 dollars from my rich aunt who lives in Canada.
I used some the money to buy some clothes and shoes but I think that I don't have a way to spend all this money. I would like to give you half of it, would you like it?
I can donate a part of it, I think I will donate it to sick kids that are in danger.
What would you do with the 5,000 dollars which you're going to get from me?
with love, your friend
