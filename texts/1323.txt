Don’t you hate when people treat you like a baby?

That’s exactly what happened to me when I went out to a movie with my parents.  As we walked into the ticket booth, my mom said @two adults tickets and one for my kittle baby here!”  I was so embarrassed, I wanted to be buried in the ground.  The ticket man looked at me and smiled, and I almost cried.

Then, we went to buy some popcorn before the movie.  My dad and I reached the counter, and called the young man that stood there, suddenly my dad said: “One little popcorn for my little “madam” and one coca cola for me!”  The young man looked at me and gave me a strange look.  This was the most embarrassing moment in my life.  I think my feelings were very much alike to the feelings of the writer, because he also wanted to bury himself underground, and I think that the girl in the story couldn’t ask her parents to stop slurping, because that’s the way they act and she didn’t want to hurt them like I didn’t.  However, in both cases the embarrassment is caused by the family, by my.
