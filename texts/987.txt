It was a nice day when the sound was heard I started to run but lets start from the beginning. One boy from the class came to me in the morning and asked did you bring the battery and I said no. He asked me to bring battery in the day before so we can explode a bomb that he will bring. How pity he said we can't explode the bomb, but we can born it. I said and he agreed. Well in the end of the lesson we went to fields next to school and tried to born it, but we did succeed. Well in the end of the lessen after a hour we tried again and it start born I was at the library when it start born and someone came and tell that it start born and we run together the place when we came there was a 10 children from our class who was looking and the fire suddenly there was a big sound I can't even imagine him and all the children who was there started run. I ran to my class and set in my place. Then all the children come to the class and we all were frightening. Just the kid who bring the bomb did arrived then he arrived at the end of the lesson and our teacher is our principal said that he is suspected him. Later the police came and start search in the place of the noise came from. A few day later the kid that bring the bomb was asked to write a apology because the principal know that he was bringing the bomb. Lucky that it over like this and no other way.
