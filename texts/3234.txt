In last friday I went to my cousin's bat mitzva. I went with my family to the mall to buy new clothes for the event. When we got to the event, my cousin's family waited for us outside, they look very excited when they saw us because we were at vacation on Italy and we come back just for their event. By the time we talk with one of my cousins many people have been come to the event when the event started it was very bored. everyone sit and no one dance. It was like that all the event until it end.
I was very dissapointed from the event.
