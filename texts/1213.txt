The time is 10pm and Adi wants to go to buy her some clothes, it’s late to do these things mum said and besides, what kind of clothes do you want to buy?

I’ll buy what I feel like to buy.

How are you talking to me?  You should respect me, talk to me well.

I am talking well, you always have something to say about everything I do or say.  I don’t want to be in clashes with you.

Ok, how much money do you think to spend about your clothes?

About 400-500 shekels.

What?!  Where do you have this money?

You forgot that I was waitress at the hotel?

Yes, but you’re going to spend all this about clothes?

Mum this argument is for vain, we’re talking for nothing.  I know that I’m going to buy clothes, with my money, that I worked for it and that’s it!

Adi went and closed the door hard.  She was upset and mother was very angry, because her 15 years old daughter do whatever she feels like to do.

Adi came back a1 o’clock pm, her mother was sleeping.  In the morning Adi and her mother talked, and they got to argument.
