In my opinion, the suggestion that the classes will be split and taught in two shifts is a bad idea.

First of all, children who are not studying in the morning, will find a job, and then they won't come to study in the afternoon because they will be tired.

In addition, students should study in the morning because they can concentrate in the lesson.  Our brain can concentrate in the lesson.  Our brain can think rightly in the morning.  They will understand the material good and then do homework in the afternoon at home.

In conclusion, it is better that the students will study in the morning.  In this way they will succeed in the examinations and the grade of the school will be high.
