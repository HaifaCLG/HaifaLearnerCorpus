I want to tell you about an event that me and my family had. We went to a resturant to celebrate my birthday, it was last year, My parent's invited 30 pepoles and we went to an Italien resturant. Some of the most importent pepole were good friends from my parents that came from Einglend. We had listened to Rock music like Guns ' Rose and Queen. We ate Italien food like pasta and pizza. The most supraising think was that my famlly bought my a new cellpohone, I was so surprised and happy. It was a very good birthday.
