Dear friend,
This year my grandfather gave me a lot of money, and I am realy happy.
I want some computer gemes for my computer of some disks to hear in my radio. Maybe should I Buy a good dvd movie. maybe "xman", or "The pirates of the caribbians..."
I think I should Buy the "spider man 3" movie. I and my father watched this movie toghether in cinema.
It is a great movie, full of effects, and owsome sound.
