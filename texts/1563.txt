When we hear the expression “family” we imagine in our mind, mother father and children, but if we meet two fathers and two mothers with their babies, it’s not look fine because it is immorally and if we back to the name of these families “non-traditional families”, we see the word non-traditional that means the tradition that our father saved didn’t called us of kind of making family.



However there are many reasons that accused to this situation, it will be adults who comes from destroyed families - of course they didn’t get the advice and the right way that they should know about how to make a good family which the society and the bible accept with it and how to choose the right man or woman in the right time. Another reason would be when the parents get divorced and didn’t think about their children’s future. That’s right that there are rights to the homosexual and our country respect them, but on the other hand they will have children on the future and this marriage really affect them also affect the whole society.





About the “single-parent families”, that is more likely than “same sex families” but it is also incomplete.



All kinds of these families “the non-traditional families” the babies are the most affected because this families can’t give the good raising that they be or enough of love …
