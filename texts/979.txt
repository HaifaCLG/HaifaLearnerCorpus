It was last year. I was sitting in a ceremony in the holocaust day. Everyone were quiet, and sat still on there places. It was a sad day and a hard day for everyone. Teachers from all of the classes, spoke and read poems and songs about the holocaust. Suddenly a song of an Israeli famous signer were put on the tape, with a loud volume. Every one were listening quietly and I thought about the lives of the Jews that were destroyed in the holocaust. It has really a sad song and it moved me. From that day, every time I hear this song I remember again that ceremony. In the end every one stood up and sang the anthem. It was a teaching ceremony and I will always remember it.
