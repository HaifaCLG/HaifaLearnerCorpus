The events in the picture takes time during the brake in school there are 2 pupils play basketball, a teacher shouting a little boy for doing something bad, 2 little girls study together in the school brake, there's 2 more pupils one who listen's to music alone in the corner and the second plays guitar. 2 little girls standing in the middle and gossip about stuff.
there's a broken window in the house probably the pupil that the teacher shout at did it.
and there are shoes hanged on the other window who might be belonged to the guitar guy because he have no shoes.
