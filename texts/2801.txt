In Pesah, me and my family ate a big meal and spcial, for the holiday. A big part of my family came to my home, for celebrating Pesah. Before eating, we sat and talked about news and more. then we went to table and made "seder pesah" and ate the meal, the meal was pretty tasty, then, we kept talking.
