My name is Alex Boaron. I am 23 years old. I live in a beautiful city called Netanya. Netanya is a big city, which is located near the ocean. The city of Netanya offers all kinds of entertainment such as pubs, restaurants, cinemas etc.


I am the youngest in my family. I have three brothers and one sister they are all married, and they all have babies. I have ten nephews and nieces. The oldest is 17 years old, and the youngest is only 1 month old. I have been an aunt since the age of six. I love all of them very much and enjoy spending time with them.


I live at home with my mother and father, and also my cat. My mother is a house wife and my father runs the family business. We own a Butcher shop and a delicatessen and we export fresh meet to supermarkets all over Israel. All of my family works together in the business, and they like working with each other. I almost forgot, Fiama is my cat she is 10 years old and she has been living with me since the age of 1 month.


I have been riding horses since the age of 8. I own a horse his name is Rolandos, he is 7 years old. He is a beautiful chestnut horse, with a long white stripe on his forehead. I brought him from the Netherlands 3 years ago. I love horses, they are wonderful creatures.I practice in show jumping, and I also participate in shows each week. I consider horses and especially Rolandos as an inseparable part of my life. I hope to be able to ride horses for many years to come.


Now the private part of my life is my boyfriend Bennie. Bennie is 25 years old. He is almost two years older than me, and I love him very very much and we have been together for a bit more then 4 years.
