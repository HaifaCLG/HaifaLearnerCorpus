I think that overcrowding is a negative thing.

I don’t agree with those suggestions because it isn’t smart that classes be split and one half of the class will study on the afternoon.

On one hand this is a solution of the problem and it’s already good.  The advantages are that it will be more comfortable in the class both teachers and students.  The teachers will be more easy to teach because there isn’t a lot of students.  The students will be more concentrate in class.

On the other hand there is disadvantages because other half of the class will have to study on the afternoon and it’s not comfortable.  The students won’t be concentrate in class.

Finally I think this isn’t a good idea and my opinion is to split the class to two classes.
