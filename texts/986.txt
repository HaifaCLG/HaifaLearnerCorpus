This story started before a long time, when my friend that call Michal told me that her family fly to abroad for two years. So I told my parents all this and they said to me Maybe you will fly to her. I thought that they laugh at me, but no. In the summer I worked very hard and saved a lot of money. The year began, we learned, month pass and another month. Nilil my friend and I stated to think seriously about the fly. We went to Beni our teacher  and told all this story. He said that he need to talk with his friend to the work. Another week pass and Beni wanted to see our parents it started be very strange. My parents came to school and talked with Beni, after they come home, they told me that they think that Beni will tell us that we can't fly. My friend's parents came, and altogether they talked with Beni they told us the same things that my parents said. But we wanted to fly. Another two weeks pass and Beni called us to his room. Nili and I start to be afraid. We aren't slowly. We knocked on the room's door and got in. Beni started to tell us what happened 3 weeks ago when we came to him. We waited and waited that he will tell us if yes, or no. But he continues, and in the end of his speech he said that we can fly abroad. We smiled at him, and when we went out we jumped and screamed. It was great. Before two weeks we flied abroad to London, to our friend that call Michal. It was very unexpected that Beni will say yes, it was wonderful.
