6:35 I wake up
6:45 I start dressing up
6:50 I go brush my teeth
7:05 I get my hair and make up done
7:20 I'm taking a walk with my dogs
7:25 taking some thing to eat at school
7:30 I'm walking to school
My family gets up a little bit later so I dont know what thay do ussualy.
The picture:
in the picture there is a mom a bay and a girl. the mom is looking thruth the window and the kids are eating. on table there is bred, milk, juise, butter, and salad. the kitchin looks orgenized and clean, very comeftable. in ther kitchin there is a table, chais, clock, picture, clozets, window and a lot of other things. I think that the kids in the picture is during the brak fast, before brak fast they get up and brush their teeth dress up, and brush their hair. anfter brakfast I think the go to school.
