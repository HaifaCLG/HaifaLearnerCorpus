Dear John

How are you?  I wanted to write you about something that I saw the after day in my classroom.

It was a very large table with a nice blue sky color table cloth with a fringes hanging free.

On the table cloth there was a shiny silver vase.  Full with lovely bright flowers that looked like it just picked from the garden.

In front of it there was the most beautiful candle holder red and yellow with a big white candle inside.
