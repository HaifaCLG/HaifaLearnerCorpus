When we think about euthanasia the main priority to support it is the patient’s welfare. The patients have the right to end their life with dignity, respect and pride. Therefore, when they can no longer take care of themselves they become totally depended on other people to feed; wash and dress them etc etc. All their pride is taken away from them. We should also respect their wish to be remembered as they were before the terrible disease destroyed them.

The second reason is the patients’ suffering and agony. The patients ‘ daily routine involves continues intense pain. Most of the time they are under the influence of strong painkillers that make them incoherent. Some patients’ conditions are so terrible that the idea of living is not an option for them, and euthanasia seems to be the only way. In addition patients that are terminally ill will probably suffer numerous pains for the rest of their lives, so why prolong the suffering?

Also for the patients to take into consideration is the stress and worry that they have on their families. The effects of seeing someone you love terminally ill may also have an influence on the patients’ decision to choose euthanasia. We have to ask ourselves is it morally right to prolong someone’s life when there is no quality of life left, and there is no hope of a recovery for them. I think that if euthanasia were an option a lot of pain and suffering of the patients and the families would be avoided.
