Now five years after we finish school, we all together again. We all decided to go to Gadi and to try to remember about the good old days. School was really good but also bad. We had a lot of friends. A lot of fun in the afternoon, the parties we did, the girls we met Oh, do you remember the old teacher who teach us physics he was a very big gay. Do you remember the picture we done to him in the end of the year? It was the last day in school today before five years. We wanted to show him who we are after two years that he was shouting at us and do us a lot of trouble. In the end we did to him picture but he steal don't know that we did it. We talked about other teachers and friend who are abroad now and we will meet other after more five years.
