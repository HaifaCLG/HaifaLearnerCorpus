The event is my bar mitzva, on the first day we went to zfat to an old synagog and I "HENACHTI TFILIN" and I have read an "Parasha", and then we had an "buffe" out of the synagog. then we traveld in old zfat, and then went to "Fimonim" Hotel to eat lunch, we have eaten a chicken, rice, and sweet. in my bar mizva 5 of my freinds were there and all my family.
on "Shabat Hatan" I was in the Sfaradi synagog. I have readen a part of the bible, and a lot of candys attacked me. then we went to "Eshcol A Pais" and we have eaten food.
My family suprised me by buying an guitar + reciever + computer. I was shocked!
