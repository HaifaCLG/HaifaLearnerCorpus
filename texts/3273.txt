Hey Daniel.
You'll never belive what I'm telling you now1
My grand father had won the loto! Can you belive it?
And he gave fore my own 2,000,000 shekels!
This is so exited, I already bought the guitar that I had been dreaming all the time and a big amD 200V!
In addition, I bought a car for the fuatre.
so... I have some options to do something with the money wich left:
(1) I can fly to USA for a trip, and this is include you, I want to take you with me, I sure we'll do a gret time!
(2) I can more to a new house.
What would you do with the money if you were me?
