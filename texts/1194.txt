Violence has become part of our lives.  It began from our society, the way we educated in our home, the way that we talk with other people in the street.

People in our society doesnâ€™t behave well, and argues about stupid things.

If we have a good breeding all this thing would never happened.  In Israel violence has become more and more worst, that it would in the last years.  A little children fight with other children on the way it look like on TV.  The violence do the life very difficult, and now we have a hard working to solve this hard problem, and to clear up a misunderstanding life.
