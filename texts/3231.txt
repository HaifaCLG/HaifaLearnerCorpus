I have a relatively small family, and they every family dinner is never followed by fussy arragements. We are only four members, and whenever any sort of celebrating approach, everyone gets to do his own task in the preparations. Seventy percent of it all falls on my mother, and it provides a lot of reasons for her complaints. However, she never lets anyone near the kitchen a do something that she planned to do on her own. The rest of the work is done by me and my sister, while my father has some time to ... an afternoon light. He never helps around much, but makes sure to check everyone else's progress. The dineer itself is always quite enjoyable, thoughouts we discuss daily routine matters we find them funnier than we would have if we had thought of it alone and not in a cozy atmosphere of family dinner.
