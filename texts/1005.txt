I live in Petach Tickva. I am living there for 15 years. Now my parents decided to move to Nirit a new village in Israel. We are going to leave Petach Tikva in about a month. When I'll live in Nirit, I won't be abe to learn in town because its far away so I had to start the year in the school which will be close to my new home. I didn't want to come to this school. Its not fair. I told my parents. All my friends are learning in Petach Tikva, I don't know anyone there. I didn't want to listen to them, and I didn't know what to do. I looked and I didn't really have any other choice. On the first day of school I came to this new school without knowing anyone here. But now, 4 months later I'm a happy girl. I wouldn't agree changing school for anything. I love my new school and I didn't think this will ever happen to me. I have many new friends and I can't think of what was happening if my parents couldn't convince me and if I was learning in the city.
