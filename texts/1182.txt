Boy that enjoy with his friends and came back home late –

Where are you been until now <NAME OMITTED>?

But what have I done?

What you have done?  You ask us what you have done, shame on you irresponsible almost and we phone the police  because of you.

What do you want from me everybody stay until now.

We don’t care from other we care from you we worried to you.  Where are you?  What happened that you don’t come back and you enjoy with your friends, came back home late and said what we want.

So what do you want from me?

Think in yourself, you need to know.

Ok I understand I am wrong and I really sorry about that and I promise that I never do that again.

What I think of the dialogue –

I think that the parents are right because <NAME OMITTED> came back late and they worried to him, maybe something happened to him and he enjoy with his friends and even don’t think about this that he need to message that he will come back late and then he was prevent the worry from his parents.
