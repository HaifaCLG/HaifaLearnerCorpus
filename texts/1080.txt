Once I had a dog. I succeed convincing my mom to have one. Its name was Jafi, and she was so cute. Every morning when I sent to school she was running after me and when I came back she was jumping on me and it was so good to know someone who loves you waits for you at home and cares for you. Its mom just lived at the next door neighbors and Jafi was always going there to visit her mom. But our neighbors didnâ€™t like her. She said that Jafi is a trouble maker and she didn't want it to come to her. But Jafi did not understand she loved her mom. So one day she just disappeared. We looked for her everywhere. We don't know where she is until today but we can only guess that our good neighbors took her somewhere.
