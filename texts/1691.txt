A Tel-Aviv University study group has advised the Israeli police to base the amount of fines for motoring offences on how much the offender earns, rather than having a fixed fine for a particular offence. In my view, this advice has no moral justification. The matter of crime and punishment in general, should not be subjected to positive discrimination of any kind (also known as corrective preference) and under any circumstances.

The study group's suggestion is a populist one, as it fits today's general approach of benefiting the groups of the lower socio-economic backgrounds. But will those groups really benefit from such a change in legislation, or will they be worse off in the long run? I think that such a change will deepen the gap in society between the rich and the poor: People of lower economic status might be looked upon, unequally and patronizingly, as people who didnâ€™t fully pay their dues to society and therefore do not deserve the same treatment from different state authorities, such as courts and hospitals.

They say that we are all equal in the eyes of God; we should be as equal in the eyes of the law. If a person lost his life on the road as a result of a motoring offence, his loved ones will have to pay the same emotional price of grief and loss, regardless of their social or economic background. Why, then, should the price paid by the offender differentiate according to his/her economic background?

The latter equation, about equality in front of the law, applies not only to motoring offences, but to all kinds of crimes and offences in general. A punishment ought to fit the crime and not the offender and this is what all of us, members of a modern society that stands for true equality, should aspire to.
