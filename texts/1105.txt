When I was a kid I had a dream. I wanted to be a formula 1 driver. I started to save money since I was 15 and when I got my international license I flew to England to Jim Russell school for rally drivers, I started driving the car when I was 16 and when I got my license I was already a very good driver. When I got there he saw I had talent and he wanted me to stay for more time after a few days I won my first formula ford race and he asked me to compete for him. I won more races and he told me I can go to formula 3000 I raced there for a year and went to formula 3. There I was for 2 years and there I met Gerard Berger a very good formula 1 he told me I had talent and wanted me to try driving his car. At the beginning it was very hard but after half an hour I got used to it, and he told me that his second driver left the team, and asked me if I want to replace him. I agreed and after a few races he got sick and I replaced him. I was very exited and I didn't start good but later on I was in the second place and I finished like that. The team manager was very pleased with the place and he wanted me to go also in the next race. When I got to the second race I started very good and finished first. From then on I was very good and won almost all the races. The second season I broke the first place and my company took one firs. A few days ago I met a young and very good driver and I think I can put him on the team.
