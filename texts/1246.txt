In my opinion sports should be a part of everyone’s life even without school physical education lessons.  Furthermore, I don’t agree that physical education should be compulsory for all high school students.

Students who has physical difficulties, and has a permission from a doctor to do not participate in PE lessons, would be the only one who choose whether they like or not to participate.

Especially nowadays, PE lessons are made not only for children with athletic skills, but rather for every student.  In fact, everyone could pass with a good grade using minimal effort.

Finally PE lessons are very important and this times of technological develop, machines do many things instead of humanity.  This develop makes people lazier, which causes lots of disease and illness which makes sport much more important.
