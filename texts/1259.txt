I have just finished all my Bagrut exams.  It were the most difficult month I have ever had, I am so glad it’s over and I don’t think I am going to miss it.

I know my life is going to change.  Not only will I have time for myself, I won’t need to think about tests.  Therefore I will be able to travel, to work for and make some money for driving lessons for example.

It’s obvious I am going to celebrate this occasion by going to Eilat to relax from the tests and to feel the freedom from school.

In conclusion I am happy it’s over, but if I want a good job I must study more after the celebration and that’s what I am going to do.
