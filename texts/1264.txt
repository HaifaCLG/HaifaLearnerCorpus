Overcrowding.  Is there an easy solution?

At many public and private schools we run into the problem of overcrowded classrooms.  A serious problem that we all must try and think of a solution because it affects not only the ability of the teachers to do their jobs but also the students to learn properly.

One idea brought up as a solution was splitting the class into two groups and teaching into shifts.  Morning and afternoons  I myself think it’s a very creative idea which can work.  Theoretically it would be great, smaller classes, more attention from the students to the teachers and from teachers to each student but will it really be like that?  Think about the students, separate from half their classmates.  And of course the fact that children will start switching their night and days and not having time for after school activities.  It won’t be difficult for the students only.  Think about the teachers that will have to teach twice per class the same material.  Working twice as much each day.  Surely – they won’t have as much patience for the students on the afternoon shifts.

That is only my opinion, you can call me pessimistic, I can’t hear you anyway. That was my point of view.  I wish it would be the wrong one and that the idea will work eventually.
