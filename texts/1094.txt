One day I went with my big sister to buy a little dog. The little dog was so cute. He have many fur and he have face black and brown. And he have a white spot on back and my mother love him very very much. The dog go to the kitchen and go sleep. He came the morning to my room because he want to do pee then I want with the dog and said and go to the street and he play outside with the ball and I pay with the dog then he got a dinner and then he go to sleep because he was so tired. Two years ago he grow and we take him to the competition of beautiful and he came to the two place then he came home and we go to sleep.
