It all starts when a new girl came to live next to my house. Before that I was a religious girl like all the girls at my class, and my relationship with my parents was fine. She was a find looking girl and she looked older from her age.


I don't remember how is it exactly happened but my relationship with my parents got bad.


I spend at her house more time from my house and my father didn't like it, he punished me after I color my hair, after I went to a disco when he told me not to. I didn't understood that he is love me and care about me. I didn't listen to him and I done all the things that he didn't let me.


The girl (her name was Galit) date with older boys, I liked it.


One day Galit introduced me a boy, he was 3 years older and he was fine looking. We went to movies and to discuss and I thought we were friends, I loved him.


My mother always told me not to trust on a guy like that but I yell at her and told her that she don't know what she is talking about.


One day I went to a movie with Galit and I saw him with another girl, a girl from my class. I started crying and I didn't know what to do. Galit told me that nothing happened and that it is normal that he is going out with another girl, and that he can't go out just with one girl.


I decided that I can't live like that and that I don't want to see him or her.


Now I understand what my parents told me.
