In the last year, I flew to London. I slept in hotel with my family. We went to many famous places in London like; the "London eye", "Hide Park", "The Tower of London" and more.
One day, I went to sharon's house. We SHAMANU his mother talking on the phone with sharon's bat DODA. His mother ask her: "which animals you saw at the zoo?" and she said:"father". Me and sharon TZACHAKNU, but we couldn't stop.
