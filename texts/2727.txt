Dear Maor,
Last week, at my birthday, my grandfather entered into my room and put big envelop under my pillow.
whill all the guests were in the living room, my grangpa called me to my room. He showed me the envelop and told me that it's my birthday present from them. In the envelop there was a winning loto card. The prise was 2 millyon Dolars!!!
I was very happy. I hug him and told him thanks, like millyon times, And he just said: "I know that you will the wright thing with the money.
Now I dont really know what I should do with the money.
I can keep him, and use him when I will grow up and realize more about life. or I can use It now on games, new computer, new TV, ect.
Maybe I will donate it to poor people.
I dont realy know...
I will happy if you will help me with my dillema.
