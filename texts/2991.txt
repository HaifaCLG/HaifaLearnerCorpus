Last year in "Hanuca" my grandmother invented all my family to her garden. She promised that she would make a special food.
When we came to her we started to eat and didn't say hello to anyone. My mother was very sad.
I told her that we were so hungry so we forgot to say hello and if she felt angry she need to breath deeply until she felt OK. I put happy music and the my grandmother started to be happy. All my family sat around the table and sang a sing.
