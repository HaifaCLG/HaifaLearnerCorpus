When I became thirteen year old boy, like every jewish person, I had a bar mitzva. It was real exciting, to think that in one day you become from a boy to a men. I remember everybodey was so excited for me. my mother were the most excited, and she even took me to buy a special clothes for this. In the big they I remember I wake up earlier then everybodey and wonderd how is it going to be. about 6 clock in this day all the family was orgenized and ready to leave, we got to the synagoge and all the other family was already there. after a while it was in my big moment, I couldn't breath but when I think about it now I think it was pretty funny. after I red from the Tora, everyone were excited and happy.
