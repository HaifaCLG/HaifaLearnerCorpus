I eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. At the morning sometimes I eat breakfast and sometimes not because I usually don't have enough time. When I eat breakfast I eat serials with milk or yogurt. At lunch sometimes I eat rice and sometimes maccaroni with souce or shnizel. At dinner I eat or omlette or potatoes it's depend on which day we are.
In the weekend we make something different from what we eat in the middle of the week; In the weekends we do cakes, But the meals aren't different from the meals in the middle of the week.
My favorite meal is the lunch because I love what I have to lunch. I think tha thte most important meal is the breakfast because it gives you the energy you need to the rest of your day. My favorite food is shnizel because it's tasty.
I like pasta and pizza too.
