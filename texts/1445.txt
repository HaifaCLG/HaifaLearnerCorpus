Over the last centuries the world witnessed a real progress in technology which influences our lives in so many ways. Moreover, this progress made our lives extremely convenient. The transition from horses to cars, that made transportation twice as fast, was the first important step that affected our everyday lives. However, it was only the beginning. The telegraph and telephone were the first system of communication among people. But then, the radio and television were invented and these two important inventions established the real connection between people and the rest of the world. As we thought we had seen everything the computer entered into our lives, making them even easier.


Now days, there are not many things left to invent. However, there are the gizmos, these little things that improved and still improving our lives in every aspect of life. When the television was invented, we were forced to get up every time we wanted to change the channel. Now, with the remote-control within reach, we can stand or sit wherever we like and just press buttons. When the telephone was invented we were used to run to it whenever we heard it ringing. Since then, it improved extremely, not only it became a mobile phone, it was sized to the minimum. We can put it every where we like, it is easy to carry, and most important you can reach who ever you like in any time you like, even when the person you are trying to reach is in a traffic. When the computer was invented, it

looked like a complicated big box, that frightened many people. Today, computers come in every shape and size we want, and every little child knows how to use it. The computer entails a whole world that we can reach only by entering it.


We should thank, Alexander Graham Bell, Gugliemo Marconi, Mores, and other great inventors, that set the basis for our modern system of communication. These inventions

led to the later, little inventions, that are called gizmos.
