Dear Dani,
How are you? I didn't see you a very long time. I wanted to tell you that I go t a lot of money for my birthday, million $. I got them from my mother. I gave 99,990$ to people in needs and victims of teror.
Now I have 10$ and I don't know what I have to do with it should I have to buy with him a mustic? Which is very sweet or should I have to buy a book? Which is very interesting. I think that I will choose to buy a mustic. Because it sweet and I'm not a person of books.
What would you do with the money if you were me?
miss you, see you soon,...
