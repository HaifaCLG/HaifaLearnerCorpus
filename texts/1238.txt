Hello, since I not gave you the work on new year I’m give you work on Sucot and about what I’m doing at Sucot.  So… on leave I’m going to two trips from Bnay-Akiva at north both for same place but them different because the first trip just for one concoction for journey so as to know the tracks well and the second trip it same trip but now this from pupils and on tracks we kept them and talk to them about the place.

The trip is on Galil Elion and walked on river Bezet and river Acsiv and on night one and all sleeped about the grass at sea beach the place fixed.

On trip one and all delighted and recognised people full anyhow for example from Petach Tikva Karni Shomron Shoui-Shomron Enau et cetera.

Exterior thereof on leave Sucot I’m learnt to history because there is test.

Conclude the leave Sucot passed good and I amused very much.
