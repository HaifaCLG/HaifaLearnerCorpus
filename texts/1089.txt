Once there was a boy named Star and he was very rude and wild. One day he did not have a lesson so he prowled around school he found this hole in the roof at the laboratory so he decided to explore he crawled in and discovered its leads in to the lab, any way he jumped in and filled his school bag with just anything he could chemicals, tools, just anything when by accident a glass fell on the floor and broke. When the teacher came in she saw a boy in the locked lab with a broken glass at his feet and a rod of magnesium in his hand. 10 minutes later he was sitting in the managers office with about a school bag full of lab instruments on the table.
