Nataly get up for school!


I’m too tired and my boyfriend, David, is coming to take me to school at 10:30.


Ten o’clock!  It’s too late!  Are you crazy?  Go now to school or I will ground you for a month!


I told you that David is coming to take me to school so leave me alone!, and close the door behind you!  I want to sleep.


I don’t like David, and I don’t like you hanging round with him, so I don’t want to see him again in my house, is that clear!?


I don’t ask you who to go out with!  I’m a big girl!  So leave me alone!


You know what?  I’m going to tell it to your father and then we will see what he is going to do with you!  Boom!?  She closed the door.


Nataly started to cry she told herself:  I must run away, I can’t live with her anymore and then she fell asleep.


David is honking from his car.  Nataly runs for him.  She has a smile on her face.  She gives him a kiss.  When David saw the bags he was shocked.  She told him her story he said to her that she can stay in his house.
