(1) I am really happy to wake up every day, to take a deep breath in front of the window and look stright to the sun, take a look at the beautiful flowers and trees that are growing happily at our back yard's garden, fill myself in renweed energy and power.
After all that (acasually it's not that long, only ok mnute or two), I go to clean my teeth, have a shower, dress up and it.
And if you think that all the breathing part was long and boaring, together with the rest organizations for school, i am happy to say, that it take me about half an hour, or forty minutes max.
When I finally end all thas things, I go hapilly to school, to meet my friend, and study. Have a nice day too!
(2) In this picture I see two little kids, sitting next the table and eating breakfast. There mother is doing something in the kitchen, maybe dishing the plates, or looking out of the window. The kitchen itself looks really nice, clean and esthetic, the children look happy, the food looks nice - bread, milk, salad, cheese... "perfect family" what calls.
I guess that after the teasty breakfast the children would go to the kindergarden, laught and play and their mother continue cleaning, or working. what a wonderful life.
