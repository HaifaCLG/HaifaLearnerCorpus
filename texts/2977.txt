Two years ago I had a "bar mitzva" party. It was very excited, all of my friends came and I was very happy. We danced all night long. ate a lot of traditional food of the Russian caulture. Before the event I went to the hair Salon and idd a nice hair cut. One week before I went with my mom to the shopping centre, and bough very expensive clothes for the event.
While all of the guests were dancing i was talking to all of the family relatives and I met alot of people that I had never seen before. In the middle of the evening two beautiful dancers came to dance with me, my parents made me a surprise.
