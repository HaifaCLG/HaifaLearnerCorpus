Dear Mike
Hi mike, how are you?
If you are asking and if you not I feel well.
I think you didn't hear about all the money I got last week.
Last week me and my brothers go to a basketball game between Macabi tel aviv Vs. Ironi Ashkellon.
That was my bithday prise from my brother.
In the chalf of the game the karoz called my name and tell me that I picked to throw ball form the free line. he told my that If the ball will come in I will get a prise and from then It all a history.
I got 5 million$.
I want to keep 3 million$ in the bank and in the money I want to buy something.
I think to buy new computer, and some things like these.

Your...
