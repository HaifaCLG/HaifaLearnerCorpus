Actually, it’s English movie which I already saw thousand of thousand times, because it’s an interesting exciting movie.

The movie presents a young, beautiful lady not rich which worked in a place where people cut their hair.

All her friends worked there.  She have fun.  But one day, she opened a magazine – and in the front of the magazine there is a picture of young handsome man – a rich successful businessman.  She fall in love with him and she decided she wanted to meet him.

So she went with her ugly car to his office.  But in her way she met him in a uncomfortable situation, she hit his car with hers.

Well, they started to argue about the cost of the damage, actually he started to shout.  She was shocked from his beauty and charm so she went after him to his stylish office and they began to argue.

She decided to invite him to a dinner because he didn’t want her to pay him any money.  So he agreed and they went to the way to a romantic live with surprises and lots of love.
