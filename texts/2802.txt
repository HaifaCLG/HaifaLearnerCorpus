Dear Rastik.
I would like to tell you about money that I got for my birthday. It was 5 thousent$ it was brought from my family in new york. Now I'm thinking how to use this money. I can buy with it and with my extra money on used car or maybe keep it in bank and buy after some years something better.
I think I should keep it in bank if I'll be really need some money. What do you think I should do?
