My special event was before a year ago. My father decided to bring me a special surprise to my birthday, so my parents took me to do skydiving. I was very excited before that, and I wasn't frightend. Before I was jump down from the airplane, I looked down and I was so far from the ground. For a second I was fear, but then I jumped. It was the most wonderful adventure I've ever done. it felt great to be up there and look down at all the beautiful view. I'll never forget that.
