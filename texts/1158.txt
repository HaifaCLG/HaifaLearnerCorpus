Recently we are witness to wave of violence in all kinds of forms, in our country.  I want to focus on violence at families.  This problem is getting worse in view of the latest publicities in the communication:  murders wives, physical and literal abuse, even setting fire to children – and that isn’t all, after doing it the offenders excused their extreme action to their poor economic situation, the partner behaviour and a lot of other reasons that I don’t accept, I think that the main reasons is disparagement of the police to this problem , and the easy punishments to these offences.  The solution is hard policy against that kind of behaviour, moreover,  to prevent those events there needs to be awareness in the public to this problem, therefore there is requirement of large assistance centres that will provide service and family consultation.  Maybe then we will see some change.
