Hello,
How are you?
As you now yesterday was my birthday and I got alot of money from my family and friends. This morning I checked how much money I got, it was 2,000 shekels! I didn't expect for so much money and I confused about how I will spend it. It just I thought to do a big happing in the Kerion, but then I understand that I can spend it better, like go to vicaition. For now, I didn't do anythign with the money, maybe I will save it to the time when I will be short of money and I will really need It. In the end I really want to go to vication and enjoy the money.
What is your opinion about my plans?
I wait to answer from you.
Bye
Your friend...
