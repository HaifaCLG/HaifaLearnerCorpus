All the year I wanted to be in the summer â€“ it was a very cold winter that year and I couldn't wait anymore, I wanted to be in the summer.


It was a very long year by finally the summer holidays weren't so far away and I've started to think what to do. I had several ideas but just when I thought that I will spend my holidays like always, I'll go on a trip and sleep a lot but then suddenly a great idea come to me, it will send my parents to Europe and have all he house for myself.


After many discussions, I persuaded my parents to go and they left, but that after they told me 1,000 times that I have to promise them that I will water the garden every day, and I promised them.


It was a wonderful 2 weeks, I invited friends every day, I did parties, and really enjoyed my life. I did all the things that I have dreamt doing that year and the most important thing that I have the entire house to myself. Those two weeks went very quickly, and I couldn't believe when one morning they came, I was sad that the time I had  ..

Out? But I was happy to see them, and I couldn't understand why they had a strange look on their faces, until suddenly I remembered the garden!
