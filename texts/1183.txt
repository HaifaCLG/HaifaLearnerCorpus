Clashes between parents and sons are unavoidable and sometimes necessary to build a healthy relationship;  every family or even couple have to argue to make a place of their self inside their houses and between them self.


In my opinion it is normally and even healthy to make now or then (every few month) a constructive argument between parents and their children.


On one hand you can say that clashes do not help to build any relationship.


On other hand an argument can be constructive and helpful for plenty of people, who have to have an argument between themselves so that they will have the strength to  empower them self and work in full power to find happiness.



Where have you been?

Do you know what is the time?


Iâ€™m not thinking that I should answer these question.  The question insults me and therefore I refuse to answer these question.


Do you think that you will live at our house and do whatever you want, so you are wrong.


Whenever you will leave our house, nobody will * you but until then you will behave according to our rules.


Ok, so if this is your final decision I will start looking for a new place.
