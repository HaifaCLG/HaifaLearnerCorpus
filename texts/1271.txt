If I was finished taking all my Bagrut examinations I would be the happiest girl in the world.

All my life I have been dreaming of the moment that I will finish all my Bagrut examinations.  However, today I prefer it would not come.  I feel that I am not ready enough for doing this and it is really afraid me.  Bagrut examinations has been always scaring me.  I think that when I will finish them I will relieved.

Although Bagrut examinations make me very afraid and nervous I cannot wait for the day of finish them.  I hope I will pass them with good grades.
