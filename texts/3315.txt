Dear Moshe!
How are you? Is every thing all right? I feel great now and there's something I'd like to tell you.
Last month I won 1000 Dollars from the lottery. I invested 500 of them in the bank and I bought a bike and some other things with the rest.
Next month I will be able to take out of the bank or keep it there for another month.
If I'll keep it there I will get four present on him but I really want to buy a new basketball and shoes that costs 100 Dollars.
I think I'll use the money to buy the things I want and I'll keep the rest in my house for other thing I might want.
It seems like the best option because I really want the money.
What should I do?
Looking for your answer...
