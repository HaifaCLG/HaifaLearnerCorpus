I want to tell you about my grandfather: David Koren. He is 73 years old and he have done a lot of things in his life. In the early 70's he was a member of parliament 2 times and after that he was an important man in a kibbutz. After  this job he became a mayor of the west Galilee for 4 years in this years he started writing a book on hi life on the first kibbutz near the Dead Sea that disappeared after 1948 because the Arabs attacked him in 1982 the book was finished my grandfather retired from the Galilee job and started writing another book I don't know what about but on 1985 some one offered him to come back to the West Galilee city council as a assistant to the mayor he accept it and he is working there till now. Mean while he wrote another book about his life in old Jerusalem when he was a boy. Today he is still working in the city council and a few month ago he started writing another book.
