I remember my first trip in "Hshomer Hazair", I was in the fifth grade and my frinds and I were on our way to the galil. We slept in a sleeping bag, In the middle of the wild nature, we didnt have disent food, there was no light but steel we had a lot fun. we sang song ever the open fire and our guiders were so nice everybody came back happy to their homes
