Dear Noy,
I have wanted to tell you that I got a lot of money to my Birthday celebration. I'm so excited. Finally, I will buy that leptop that I wante3d so much and a new mp4 player. I also thought maybe to buy something for my little sister. I will probably buy her the new shoes that she wanted so much but my father didn't let her.
So, I have to go, I want to take my mom to some coffee house and I will pay.
It's fun to give presents to the people you love and even buy something nice for yourself. what would you do with the money in my place?
waiting for an answer...
yours...
