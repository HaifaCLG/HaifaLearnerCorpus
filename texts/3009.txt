Three years ago, when I had bat mitzva I was very excited. Many guests were invited, But not all of them came. we ate a lot, danced and played games. It was really fun. Sudenlly I heared a scream - girl fell off the terio while she was dancing. I hoped she will be fine, but I continue dancing with the others. After half of hour a boy faint because he was in the second floor and he was afraid of high. It was surely an interesting party.
