Finally, I have finished all my Bagrut examinations, I don't need to study all day anymore â€“ till I'll go  to the university of course.  Starts from now I'll do what I want not what I have to do.  Unfortunately though I have finished my Bagrut examinations and I'm so happy, I'm a little bit afraid, I have just finished high school and now I have to make my own decisions that might affect my life.  Like I have said I'm very happy right now I just want to celebrate, the day that I have waited for such a long time has finally come.  My friends and I want to do something fun, but we haven't decided yet, I don't think that it really matters where we'll go, I think that we will be happy and have fun anywhere we will go to,
