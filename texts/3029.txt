my most important acousent in my life was when I first met my second gutiar teacher, his name is Perry and I've glad to know him becuase he really helped me in playing good and progressed me.
also, he is an amazing person nice, kind, intresting and funny. we always talked a log about our lives and our problems and he realy helps me alot.
