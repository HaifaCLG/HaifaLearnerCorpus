I want to go home.


No I think we should go to the demonstration.


How can you say that we have just been saved.


Thank god that we were saved but it does not mean that we don’t have to go to support the demonstration.


Don’t you understand that I’m very tired and I want to go home to rest.


I can’t believe it.  There are people who need us.


But it not interesting me all the politics.


You are so inconsiderate.  I can’t believe it’s your country and you need to be there to fight for it.


It’s no use just stop to argue with me.





To the Girl


Here in Israel the people argue about politics they don’t agree with each other.  Some of them do not care about the people who live in North.  People who live in the north don’t want the government to hand over the Golan Heights and they demonstrate.
