Dear Itay,
I am writing this letter in order to tell you about my birthday. Last week I celebrated my birthday, I am 14 years old. It was funny day. In the morning I got my presents. I was so surprised when I saw my parent's gift. It was 5000 shekels. At the beginning I didn't want to take the money but after my parents persuade me I agreed to take it. Now I don't know what to do with all this money. I thought about some options. I can pay for dancing course which I wanted so much. I can save the money and use it later, and the last option which I liked the most is to use the money for a trip for my family. I planed to go to USA. I think it would be wonderful trip. I saved a lot of money from all my birthdays so I can use it for the trip. The trip is my favorite option because it is not just for me it is for all my family, I can thank them for my present using this trip.
