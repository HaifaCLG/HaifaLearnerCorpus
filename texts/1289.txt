Congratulations, I've just finished 12 long years in school.  I've waited so long for this moment, and I am sure that my parents also waited for it.

I'm feeling free, with no important obligation or stress.  I'm planning to take a trip in Israel and with God willing I hope to fly to somewhere, maybe Argentina or Italy.

I also want to work, I want to earn money so I would feel on my own with no help from my parents.

One thing I must not forget that now, no one is going to tell me to study, and take care of my life.  As I said before I'm on my own now.

I must add that, when you think for just a minute seriously, I realize that now I must be more responsible and I will have more obligation, not to others, but only to myself.

After all when something ends, something else begins.
