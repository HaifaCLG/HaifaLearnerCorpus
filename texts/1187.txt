three youngsters took a taxi service in Herzilya, from the pub to the centre of town.  While the taxi was on his way the youngsters ordered the driver to stop.  They shoot him and took all his money.  The taxi driver was Derek Rott.  What a horrible murder.



Although there are many violent problems, in this paragraph I want to present the main cause.  I believe that the main cause of the violence in Israel is the education or the non-education.  Education by the book, learning manners and behaving well will decrease the youngsters violence.  In order to prove my point, remember the murder of Derek Rott by a few teenagers in Herzilya.
