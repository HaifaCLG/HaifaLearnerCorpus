I want to go to Hebron as planned.

Are you mad?

Why not?

Because we just survived a terrorist attack.

But we are fine.  Just the car was wounded.

I know,  but I don’t want to come here again.

Hebron is our city.  It’s important to me to visit there.

Herzilya is our city and Hebron is the Arab’s city.

Hebron is our city from the days of Abraham.


Hebron is our city but a lot of Arabs live there.  We can’t throw them out.  It will be very peaceful to live in Israel without the Arabs but it’s impossible.  We have to live with them and we must learn how to do it.  We have to respect them and they will respect us.  In Israel there are two sections:  the right and the left.  The right parties think that Hebron is our city and the Arabs must understand it.  The left parties think that we should respect the other side.
