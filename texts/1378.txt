You know I told to my boy.  When I was in your age my dream was to be ready to be and to do everything.  I want to try everything to be rich.  I tried  a lot that I find I work a lot and I get money but just a little.  I put my money in the bank and wait that he will be much more.  But it doesn’t help to me.

One day my uncle asked me if I want to go with him to a nice place,  We entered to his car and go to a place that people sit and write in the Toto form.

My uncle asked me if I want to do it too and I said yes so he give me a piece of paper who had a place to write in and I write 1, 2 and x in them.  He paid some money and he went home.  At the way home that if I write true things (1, 2 and x)  I will get a lot of money and I will be rich.  In that days I told to my son I didn’t know what is to be rich.

After a week I get a letter I open it and inside was a cheque how look like that $2,000,000.  All that things I told to my son who sat near to me near our swimming pool and listen to me.
