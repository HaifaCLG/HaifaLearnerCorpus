When I was six, My parents want me to go play with my friends in the park.
We came to the park, and it was apsulatly boring. So me land my friend wanted to go home. When I came home, I didn't saw her anymore. I was scared. Then, all my lites turned on and all my friends were screamming: "happy birthday!" to my friend, they forgot to tell me that they're making her a birthday partyâ€¦ It was so funny!
