I can’t believe to what you did!  How could you do that to me?


What is the joke?  You come home and start yelling at me!


Oh great, now you play yourself innocent victim!


Oh it’s about your boyfriend.  Well, you can forget about him!


You are so mean, from all the mothers only I’ve got to have you!


Darling, it’s only for your own good.  He wasn’t the one for you.


No, he is the one for me and there’s nothing you can do!


Oh please, can’t you find another guy, there are plenty of them in our universe.


How can you sit right here next to me and brag about my life!  You kicked my boyfriend into the curve, you kicked him from the house.


So what, kill me for it.


If I had a chance I would. I love him don’t you understand.  But oh I forgot you don’t know nothing about feelings.  My father dumped you because you were so cold to him!  She shouted.


Don’t you dare talk about me like that young lady, she cried.  I loved your father.


Yea right Mom and you expect me to believe you that loved my father.  You cheated him with every man you met in the streets Mom, she shouted.


Go to your room!  She cried and screamed, don’t you understand he is not good for you!  He is a freak for god sake!  You are so blind she said.


I’m not blind.  I just love him.  Something that is beyond your mind Mom! she answered    *.


Young lady, don’t you ever talk about me that way!  I’m not your friend!  I’m your mother and if you forgot it’s my duty to protect you!  But you * grateful, so be it!


Go to hell.  You’re just jealous because I have somebody in my life and you don’t she cried.


Go upstairs immediately!  I don’t want to see your ungrateful face until tomorrow.


Nothing is going to stop me to love him and to be with the man that I desire!  She cried!


Look at you!  Only 15 and you talk like that!


I hate you!  I always hated you she screamed and went upstairs and didn’t come down two days!
