Technology has become a great deal of interest in our days.  In the old days, people used to go to plays and musicals, but in our century people just download movies from the Internet.  In the old days, people used to sit and read a book, but in our century people prefer to leave the book, and go see a movie.  Nowadays, every way you go, you can find computers, televisions, new electronic games for babies and son on.  In many aspects, technology has saved many lives, and allowed many people with health problems to live a life style of ordinary people.

Although, technology can be very useful, there are some situations where technology cannot exchange the real thing, for example:  when mothers leave their babies to watch television, and here stories from it.  I think that it is a mistake because, for a baby, nothing can exchange its mother’s voice and care.  Or another example, there is a new device that makes the body move – that device is sending electrical waves to the brain, and then the body’s reaction is to move and that’s supposed to be sports.  Such a device is very dangerous because such technology is unnatural, moreover, it can cause damage.  In conclusion, technology can be very useful, until a certain limit!
