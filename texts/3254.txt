I would never forget my bat mitzva birthday. I selebrated it in an ULAM that was just right to a small sinagog. It was quiet an evence! I bought new clothes, Our hair dresser made my hair curly and beautirul, my family getherd in the place, and we made the ULAM festive. We bought candles and maps' good food and cake. we had put them on the tables, and when the sun set, and the evening lights were on, my friends came and we started the celebration. we watched a short film that my granny made about my life so far, laughed, ate and danced.
It was really fun and meaningful for me, from those events which your femember for life.
