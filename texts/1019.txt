We had a chemistry test. It was quiet easy. I felt very good. I wrote a lot on the tests papers. I asked a lot of questions and the teacher answered me on them. The time was running, and I was so happy that I'm sense on these that I didn't looked on the watch so in the middle of the test the bell rang. I was in shock. I asked from my chemistry teacher to go on writing and she agree. So I went with her to her other class for keep writing my test, but thee was no chairs that I could keep writing, so I went out the classroom and sitting on the floor started to write my test from the beginning. It was unusual thing that happened to me.
