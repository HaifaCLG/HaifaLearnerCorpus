at a basketball game in tel aviv a player ran to the basket andn took the ball to it.
I and my father watch this game from YATZIA 12 at the "HEICHAL Nokia" where the players pay the basketball game.
we buy popkoren, pize, GARINIM, and cola.
at the end of the game the time was 10:30 and We come home at 1:30.
