I got a pet, itâ€™s a dog, its name is Lady. One day I played with my sister in the back yard. We played some kind of a football. When my dog noticed that we were playing she grabbed the ball and ran to her house. When I came to see what was happened to the ball, she left the ball and start running without direction. The ball had a lot of holes in it. After a while I called her but she was standing far away from me, so I started walking to her, but she started to run away from me. I understand immediately that she was afraid that I will hurt her because she did something wrong. After a few hourse while I was sitting in the balcony I saw her coming with her head down like she is think to say that she is sorry. When a friend comes to me she loves him and she never bit anyone. In the night she is always sleeping in her place and never in another one. Each day we give her something else to eat and she loves everything. She hardly bark and never bite.
