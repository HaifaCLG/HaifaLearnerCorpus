In the last few years the technology become an important part of everyoneâ€™s life.

The technology has become a part of my life in so many ways.  For example, I can find material for school in the Internet instead of going to the library.

Moreover, the technology help us to find new ways to overcome illness and save people from dying.

The technology helps me be update in the news and what happen in Israel and in the world.

In the Internet I can talk to my friends in the ICQ and in the same time I can play a game on the computer.

In conclusion, I think the technology help us in all kind of subjects and it is important that she keep developing.
