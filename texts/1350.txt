Adults.  How the they think and why the they thinking that?!  Why are adults always connect things.  For example, adults always connect “trance” music to drugs.  In such parties most of the time in India there is parties called “trance parties” and in this kind of parties some peoples taking drugs but it doesn’t saying that in all these parties there is drugs especially in youth parties that just because this parties is why adults think that in all parties there is drugs.  So parents and adults be aware it isn’t true.

In most of the parties there are no drugs at all.

Adults are always connecting oriental music to crime and the people who is listening to this music to criminals.  But most of the people listening to this music because they think that it is beautiful music.

So adults please, when you trying to clear something up do your “homework” and then decide your next move.  Don’t always believe everything you hear from people.
