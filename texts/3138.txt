Every day morning I eat a brakefast I eat cearial with milk. In school I eat a sendwich and when I come home from school I eat lanch with my family. every day I eat something different in lanch. Then in 4 oclock I eat somathing (fruit, bread with something or something sweet). and then I eat dinner.
I eat egg with salad, bread and chees. In the weekend I eat in my grandma house meat / soup - every week is different. between the whole week and the weekend there is a difference. in weekend the family eat together and we eat food many tasty.
In my opinion the most healthy meal is the brakefast because the brakefast is the meal ho brake the fast of the night.
I very like sushi and when my family and I eat sushi is in special days. it is so delicios.
I hate ketshop. I don't know why, but since I was little I hate ketshop.
