Dear friend,
A week ago I had a birthday. I got a 1500 shekels from my grandfather, my uant, from my parents, and my parents's friend.
I think that I would spent 700 shekels for shopping and shoes, and the rest of the money I keep.
I want to save some money for imergenci.
Sometime I need money for importent things and I don't have money, therfor I choose to save the money and not to use it.
If you get some mony, what would you do with him?
Do you thingk that saving the money is a good idea?
Please answer me soon.
