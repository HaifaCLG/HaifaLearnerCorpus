It was my brothers bar mitzva.
Most of the stuff were arranged by my parents. me and my sister bougth dresses and we went to a hair salon.
Our family and friends came to the event and we all had a great time.
My brother is a big fan of "Macabbi haifa" in soccer so we have made him a surprise and we gave him a record that Macabbi's players wished him a Happy Birthday. Everybody were excited and it was a great event.
