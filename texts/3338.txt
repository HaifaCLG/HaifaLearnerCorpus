The event is the brit of my cousin's little daughter.
A couple of days before the brit, the all family went to the mall to buy clothes for the event.
After 52 hours of buying clothes, my family was finally ready for the brit.
On the day of the brit, I had math lesson that I couldn't lose, so my dad picked us up and we all got dressed in the car while driving.
After this long journey, we finally arived and then we started eating. Every thing that could move was ateable.
Finally, after all the eating and the emberassing dancing we got home happy and tired.
We had a wonderful time.
