Technology has become very useful over the years.  Today, the use of technology has become very popular among people from all ages:  kids, teens, adults ….

The computer, is a part of my life.  Every day after school, I visit the Internet and I am searching the websites to find new games to play or sometimes I’m looking for a material that can help me doing tasks that I get from school.  I spend a lot of time in the computer and of course on the Internet.

The technology is the future, because it can help you in many ways.  It is an important thing that should be a part in life.

In my opinion, technology is a good thing.  For example, getting more information, playing games, news from all over the world.
