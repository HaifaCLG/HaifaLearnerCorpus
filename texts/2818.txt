in the picture I see one woman, one little girl and one little boy. they are eating lunch together the woman are making the food and the children begin to eat without her. on the table there is many kind of foods! there is eggs, milk, brid, juice, saled... in the kitchen there is oven, a frig, a window, and a lot of glasses and pots...
above the window there is a clock, and in the clock the houris seven or eight. in my opinin the children after the lunch go to play games, watch TV, play computer, the children and prebably there mother looks very have and eat the food fast.
