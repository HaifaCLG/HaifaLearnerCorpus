I want to go to Hebron the demonstration that going there.

For what you want to demonstrate?

I want to demonstrate about the people that don’t want to go out of Hebron, and I support this.

But I oppose to this, and I don’t want to go there.  I prefer to go home to Herzilya.

What’s wrong with you Liam, how you can say that?

I don’t care about politics, but if you want so much to go to Hebron  I will not stop you.

Ok, if you don’t want to go with me, I will go alone, so I see you later.

Bye.

Hi everybody, my name is Hadley and I will tell you about the situation in the country.

First of all we have argument about the people in Hebron.

Second, we have argument about get out from the Golan and Lebanon.

Third, our water situation isn’t very well and we have a lot of cases that people killed their sons and families but in spite of this our country is the best.
