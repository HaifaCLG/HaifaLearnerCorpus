Dear Dany,
As you know I had a birthday four monthes ago. I liked your present and I'm still playing that computer game.
Altough I had one party with all my friends, I had another party with my family. My uncle came to that party and gave my a present of 10,000 NIS. The first thing I did was to buy a new cell phone. You do remember the time when my phone fell into the pool, right? Then I bought some new clothes. I still got about 2500 NIS and I am concidering buying a new computer monitor or several pairs of shoes. I think I am going to buy the monitor because I play the comuter most of the time.
I hope to here from you soon. Write me about how you felt in your birtday party and if everyting goes right with you.
Best regards...
