Dear Mattis
You wouldn't believe what I got to my birth day. I got from my parents one thousand shekels, my sisters brought me five hundred shekels each and my grand parents brought me one thousand shekels together. My dad side gave me five hundred shekels and my mom side gave me five hundred shekels. All togethero is three thousand shekels! I bought with with the money xbox 360 and two games with it which are GTA and Hallo
I think I choosed Xbox 360 because it has amazing graphics and all the new games to Xbox 360 and my plastation 2 is already old and broken. What would you do with the money if you had it?
From your dear brother.
