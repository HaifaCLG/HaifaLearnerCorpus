I have finally reached my goal.  I have just finished taking all of my Bagrut examination.  I am glad that I won't need to take anymore exams of subjects that I did not choose to study (but had because they were part of my learning in school.

I have to celebrate this occasion.  I think that I will go to a vacation or a trip because I have to rest from all of the pressure I had from learning day and night for my Bagrut examinations.  Now, I can built my life.  First, I will study in the university.  Second, after I will finish learning the subject that I choose, and after I will get my degree I will find a job.  This job will allow me to start my independent  life, the real life.
