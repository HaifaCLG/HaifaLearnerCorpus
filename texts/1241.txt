First of all I want to tell about a special occasion that happened in this year.

My older sister get married, and there was a beautiful wedding.  All my relatives were in the wedding that I didn’t saw a long time.  I hope to open the new year like this year that end now.

Now, I want to talk about what I and my family did in Rosh Ha’Shana.  We celebrated Rosh Ha’Shana in Jerusalem.

In Rosh Ha’Shana evening we went to the hotel’s synagogue for pray.  After the pray we went to ate the main meal.

In the meal were special food like apple in honey, fish, that symbolise that we will be to had and not to fail, and we cut apple in honey we want our year will be sweet and good like the honey.

We also ate the pomegranate because all the seeds of his are like all the religious accepts of the Torah in number.

In the morning we went again to the synagogue for pray.  All the pray and waiting to hear the shofar.  It’s one of things that symbolize Rosh Ha’Shana.

I was very excited to hear the shofar because the voice of it is very special.

I end of Rosh Ha’Shana in drive back to Netanya and back to school.
