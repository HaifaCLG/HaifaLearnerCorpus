Six monthes ago my eldar sister got married in a beautiful place called "KALA". That morning she went to the beauty salon with my mother, and was maked up very nice. Later that day all of our closes relatives got together for family photos, and then all the guests came. I mostly danced all that night with my friends and family to an Israeli Rock and 80's 90's music. I don't know about the food because I only drank shots of alchohol, but I was told it was tasty. By the end of the wedding someone from my sister's girl friends tried to kiss my friend. It was awkward because he is 16 year old, and she is 25. I laughed about him and he rejected her immidiately.
