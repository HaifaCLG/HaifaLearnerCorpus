Hello and thank you for bringing me here to give you some advice, for being a good truck driver which will help you go “far” in truck driving career.

I will start with the driving problems.  Never drive your truck like it’s a private car.  Always remember that you carry half a house behind you.  Take example from the turtle – he walks quite slow.

Whenever you parking in a underground parking lot always look on the night meter, or else you find yourself in the garage paying a lot of money.

Always drive slowly while transferring someone’s house or else you might break something and have a very unpleasant phone call from your client.

Well, I think I have done here.  Treasure all I said.  It might help you in future and remember the turtle thing.  Thank you.
