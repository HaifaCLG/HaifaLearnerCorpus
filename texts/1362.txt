On the past twenty years Israel and the US has become an “golden opportunity” to immigrants from all over the world.

But, the reality is not so pretty as they think.  That is because, Israel and the US are a “melting pot” for these people, that arrived from all over the world.

The US of 1892 was very cruel with treating “new visitors”.  But, this cruelty has changed, and now the US is acting in more humanitarian ways with their immigrants.

On the other hand the Israeli society was too very hard with the new immigrants, and even worse than the American people.

The Israeli society has neglected in a very hard way the immigrants.  This neglect had a very bad influence about them.
