When I was 12 years old 4 years from now, I had 2 best friends – Ori and Natan – we did everything together we dated together we played together and we did our homework together.


One day we got out from my house after we did our homework and we went to play in the next field. It was a big field with many trees and bushes. Suddenly in the middle of our football game Ori stopped playing, he looked to the direction of a big tree that was not more than 100-150 yards from us. His eyes were opened and we saw he was stunned, we both looked to that direction and we almost fainted, 3 of the most weird creatures I had every seen came toward us, they stopped walking to our direction when they were about 4 meters away from us. We couldn't believe they were real. They were not more than three feet long and they were very fat and they had a very little body but very long legs and very long hands, they had big sharp ears and big red eyes. They didn't have a nose and their month was very little and they didn't have lips.


We were amazed but not scared because we know they couldn't do anything to hurt us and they looked good and friendly.


Suddenly, they start talking each one of them told us his name they were called Bonzo, Gonzo and Oliver, and they told us they wanted to play football against us so we played.


We won 15-0
