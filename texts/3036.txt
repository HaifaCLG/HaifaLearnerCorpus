In the morning I eat yougurt or dring tea
in the noon I eat what I find in the frigider: cooked food like soup, pire or spaggeti or if it is nothing like this I cook myself something like salad, TIRAS, SHNIZEL, CHAVITA or I buy myself a falafel / shawarma / pizza.
Usully in weekend I eat more cooked food.
I think that break fast is the most importent meal in the day because it gives you power for the rest of the day.
