Even though I did not witness Gili Mitchellâ€™s murder in Jaffa it affected me tremendously.


The murder was three months ago.  Gilli commented an innocent remark about a parking space, and a few minutes later he was dead.  Four guys came out of the car, and within minutes of argument, one of them pulled out a knife and stabbed him, in front of his friends.  He did not have a chance, he bled to death within minutes.  It was a very short incident., without any details or a long argument.  Gili did not know that his innocent remark will end his life, no one expected it, that is why it affected me so much.


That murder has a few aspects.  One of them is how impatient he became, how * is no longer a sacred value.  We tend to solve problems through violent instead of talking.  When those guys were questioning later on, they said they came there because their father ordered them to go and stop the party.  They came there willing to start a fight.  Gili was victim.


Another aspect of this incident is the Jewish-Arab conflict.  The victim was Jewish and the murderers were Arabs but it could be the opposite as well.  But it does not change the fact that this conflict is in too many occasions solved by violence.  Maybe there was always violence in Israel and now we hear about it more because of the media,  but it looks like violence is everywhere nowadays and we as individuals and as nation should do something about it.
