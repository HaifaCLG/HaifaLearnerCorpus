My cousin celebrated wedding six months ago.
My family didn't get organized too much, we just wore elegant cloths and went to the wedding. There were all the big family and friends who were invited. After the marriage, the music had started and we all were dancing happily.
Between the dances the were delicious and tasty meals which I enjoyed them a lot. while the celebration I ate the great food, danced a little and also talked with my family. The great meals that were served, were some delicios meat, potatoes, some kinds fo bread, and the most tasty were the desserts.
