As a school pupil who works with children whom defined as Special Education with Behaviour Problems I was witness to a lot of violence between the pupils.


Two years ago one pupil wanted to hit another girl with a broomstick.  As I saw that I rushed to take the stick out of his hands but he, without paying attention, hit me instead of the girl he meant.


I choose to write about this case, although I witnessed a lot of violent events, because it shows the lack of brakes in our society because when a pupil sees his teacher he is supposed to come down and change his behaviour but, this case shows the lack of respect to older people that are in a higher status and the lack of respect to another person in general and I think that this is the main problem in our society.  Low or even lack of respect to ourselves and to others.
