This is my worst day in my life, and I’m going to put an end for it!

We have just started the day and you want to end it.

Yes, after we have been through I want to go home.

My plans was to go to an ancient place – Hebron, and that what we going to do!!!

Don’t you understand?  We have just been attached by terrorist, and I have no intention to come back to this place.

No one, even the terrorists will prevent me to go to Hebron!

Let go, there are so many place that we can go, and it doesn’t danger!

But, don’t you understand that this places have meaning to me and to you, it’s not ordinary place, it’s very special place.

I know that you anxious to see this place but don’t you understand that we are risking our lives.  Does it worth that?

My roots are in Hebron, and if you really my best friend you will understand me and you will come with me!!!

Ok, you know your enthusiasm has convince me.
