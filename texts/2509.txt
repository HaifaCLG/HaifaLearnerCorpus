My special ivent its when I adopted my cat.
The first time when I see hem it was day after he borned. He's mothers it my freind's cat. After he borned I wait some month and then my friend brought him to my house. In this day I was very happy and exited, and my cat was very small and he little scared.
But now he is a very big and beautiful cat, he likes he's new house and he's new family, and all the family likes him.
