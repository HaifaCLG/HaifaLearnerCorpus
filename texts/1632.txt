Before some years I read a poem to 'GOBRAN KHATIL GOBRAN' from his book 'THE PROPHET' about children and their relation with parents. Its help me to recognize many things that wasn't clear to me, and it's played a good part in my life.





It happens before some years when I supposed to change high school. I wanted to stay with my classmates that I used to them. But parents refused. For them was the other school better. Maybe it's true and they wanted the best for me. The problem was that most of the student there enjoyed anormal cleverness and have very high marks. So I worried to be 'lost in this world'. In the other side I was in a situation and in an age that I can't object my parents. There 'dream' become true. Also my worries become the same. While all this was happening I read this poem to GOBRAN that gave me the strength to say 'NO' for them.





He describe in a fantastic way how is the parents love for children can change to be a trouble that affect the both sides. Although they mean well. But in many time they think that what is right for them and for their time can be acceptable always. Without realizing that the new generation not depends to them. He mention this when he say "your children are not you children they are the sons and daughters of life beings for it self". That life makes us behave as its needs.



It's right that parents have more experience that they can help their children in it. But the problem that when they use it as a way of life to all the time.



I think that love and care can bring misunderstand between the both sides. And in the end they mean well to each other.
