Hi Yuvi!
how are you? I really miss you and want you to come back!
Last week I celebrated my birthday. I got a lot of money from my father and mother's family. They gave me 1,000 shekels! I think that I'll save half of them, and half will spend in the mall. I really want new clothes and the new Nike shoes. My parents gave me a lot of presents too.
see you soon,
