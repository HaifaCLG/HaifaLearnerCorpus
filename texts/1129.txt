"Aw! It's so hard to me!" I heard a scream and began o laugh. Hi Hi Hi… it's good!!! I poured more honey and I heard again – "Haw I can't bear it any more!!! I so enjoy from this cringes!!! I come to live in this big mouth 3 months ago and I love this place it's full of leftover food and candies all the time.


How did I arrive to here? Ho it's very funny story – in a very long kiss – then I came to this place and began to build my big house here between the strong teeth – that's how they call our houses. It's fantastic to live here – even 1 time in my life here I never met the frightening tooth brush – that I hate the most.


Now, I wash the floor of my lovely house with honey – "Haw" – I heard again, "Mother, I must go to the dentist, I can't anymore!!!"


"No" – now it was I that cried. All seemed to me black – my beautiful house, my life, everything". What will I do? It's the end of me – God – please help me… the dentist will kill me".


Then I heard – "Please open your mouth" then I saw suddenly the killer instrument the one that killed my friend in my previous place "what will I do?? Bzzz Bzzz it's coming nearer and nearer and – Aaaaaaa…


Answers: I am saying the truth:

I think that the writing process hasn't changed at all my writing and it's very difficult to me to find the topic of writing every time – you know.


I think that writing in English is indeed the same as writing in Hebrew, because also in Hebrew it's hard to find topic.


I don't want you to put in the book my compositions. I don't like them – success in your research!
