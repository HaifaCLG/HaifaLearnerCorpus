In my last school we liked to go to the shop. The shop was nearly the school. The teacher didn't get as to go to the shop because they said that its very dangerous because there was some car and road near the shop. We like to go because there was ice cream and drinks, we had to sneak in the break then we had to run fast to the shop without teacher will see us. We buy something and run back. Some times the teacher were there and one day we went to the shop the teacher of English was there we enter inside she didn't see us, and we hid behind the chocolate cupboards, the shopkeeper saw us and he knew the teachers don't like  other we after going to the shop, he didn't tell her because he was very good man. When she got out we stood up, he smiled and said that he don't like in there because the teacher told him to stop sail to us we agrees with him and then we ran back, we finish the ice cream fast and we ran to class. It was 10 minutes after the bell rang. The teacher took us to the principle and we got a letter to the him. From then I stopped buy thing in the shop.
