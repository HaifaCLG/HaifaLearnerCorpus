In the recent past, we hear about a lot of cases of abuse in children by their parents. What can lead a parent to abuse his own child so cruelly?


There are a few factors that impacts the individual behaviour and cause him to act this way.  In the paragraph I will focus on one of them.  It was found, after investigating many cases of abuse that most people who undergo abuse in their childhood become abusers themselves.  For example, just yesterday I heard on the radio that a mother in Haifa used to shut her child in the bathroom and burn his hands with fags.  This woman suffered abuse in her childhood by her own father who raped her and hit her severely.
