Dear Mike,
Last week I celebreated my 16 birthday, my parents gave me 5000 shekels.
I have some options to spend my money but I don't know In which options to choose.
My father adviced me to buy a basketball because the last one was lost.
I think he is wright it is a good choosing.
After I will spend money for the basketball I want to buy new computer.
Last mounth my house was burned and my computer was destroyed so I need that.
I hope you are love my choosings.
Yours,
