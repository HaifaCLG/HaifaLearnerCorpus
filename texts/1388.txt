When I was 10 years old I had a dream.  I wanted to be a basketball player.  I wasn’t very tall but my father and mother were tall, so they told me that I’ll be tall too.  I liked basketball very much.  I worked Maccabbi TA and the N.B.A. on TV.  So I went to a tem, in Hod-HaSharon.  In a few years I became a tall player and I played better and better.

When I was 16 years old I was at the top of my career and when I was 18 years old I became a professional player (I was 1.98 tall).  After I finished the army I cam back to the team and they paid me 20,000$ for a year.  Every game I finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds.  I was ever the captain on time, but then it happened.  When I became 27 years old, we played against a team from Haifa and I hurt me leg.  Me Friends moved me to a hospital and they told me that I have to rest for at least 2 years.  It was the end.  In the age of 30 I tried to start again but it was too hard so I found myself a new job as a trainer, and I’m still doing it.

It is harder than playing because if you win so the starts are the players and if you lose so they blame you.  But I enjoy it and that’s what important.
