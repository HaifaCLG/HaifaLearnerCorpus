In 1983 Mr Bill Gates established Microsoft.  At that time it didn’t seem to march, but a few years later Microsoft made a revolution in the technology world.

Today, Microsoft has a monopoly in the computer world and almost every house with a computer has windows installed on it.

Computers today are addictive, every kid is playing computer games and uses programs such ICQ and Photoshop.  The kids use it so much that it becomes an addiction and you can find kids and teenagers sitting next to the computer up to 8 hours a day.

Some studies show that if you revoke computers from some children they will become sick and they will “need” the computer like an addict needs drugs.

In my life, I can sit next to the computer for many hours, but I prefer not to do so because I don’t want to become an addict.  I rather hang around with friends.
