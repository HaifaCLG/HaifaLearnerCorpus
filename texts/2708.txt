Dear Dan,
Hi, I wanted to tell you about my special birthday gift which I got from my grandparents. It happened two days ago when I had my birthday.
I enjoyed everything but the present from my grandparents surprised me the most.
It was 6500 shekels! They have told me that I am already big and should know how to use my money in the best way.
At the begining I didn't know what to do with all that sum but lately I realized I can spend it not only on a new computer or clothes but also I am able to use it for a trip to Eilat with my friends in the summer.
I can't choose between so much thing I can do with all that money but I think I'll finally choose the trip to Eilat.
I think that I would be able in the future to buy a new computer, or new clothes, but a trip with my friends is something realy special which I would remember for the rest of my life.
I hope to see you very soon.
