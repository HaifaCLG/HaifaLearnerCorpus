About a year ago I had a dog and I loved her very much. Her name was Linda. I think that Linda was like a people I meant it. My neighbors complained that Linda does a lot of problems and we didn't know what to do so we tie. Linda didn't like to stay like this so she torn the chain and run away. We looking her all over so one day she came to her kennel and we was very happy. The neighbors started again to complained. and one day the called to people that they kill animal. And they killed we are dog. In this day I was very sad. Because I told you that I loved her very much. I tried to save her but I couldn't. Now we have a 2 dogs. Nez and Linda. About a 3 months we had a 3 dogs but someone killed him. I don't why may be because he a very bad man or something like this. I only want to tell you that I very like animal and especially dogs and dolphin.
