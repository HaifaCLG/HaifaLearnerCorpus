Last month I broke up with my girlfriend. It started about a year ago when I went to a movie and I saw a beautiful girl, so I said to myself that that I must talk to her, so I walked towards her and suddenly she asked me if I can give her 30 agurot because she haven't go enough money for a bus, so I told her that if she would sit next to I would be glad to walk her home after the movie.


So after a few days I saw her again, I shouted to her and we sat down and started to talk. A few months passed and the relationship between us was great, we were very good friends, but the last weeks I haven't seen her until one day I saw her walking with someone. I went to her and suddenly she told me that she doesn't want to be my girlfriend anymore and that she found someone better from. Today she is in hospital.
