These days were so easily for us. we needed to learn and we did so fun afternoon and the evenings now we stuck hear wet out our family and out old good friends. We don't come home all week and sometimes we don't come home on Fridays. On these days I so hate the school but now I so missing to come back to here. Then I so hate to learn to the tests, but now I prefer to learn and don't be hear in the army.
