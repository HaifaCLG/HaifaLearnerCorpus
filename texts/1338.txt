Today, the technology take over our live very fast and very quickly.  Almost everything you see, eat, drink or wear is a product that was made thanks to the technological revolution.  The main reason for the popularity of technology is that it made our life much simpler than it need to be.  Children and teenagers (like me) today come more open to new ideas and things.  That way of thinking help them “welcome” the new things that technology proved more the older people.  That is why, in my opinion, we find children more next to computer and TV than playing outside.

50 years ago, when our parents were young, people hadn’t had computers and TV in every house and that convince them get out.
