Once there was an old lady, when was married, but she didn't like her husband very much and she was not nice to him, at home she always told him what to do and he did everything she said without arguing. One day she came back from shopping in the market and she held bags in every hand. She went up the stairs slowly and finally when she came to her apartment door she called loudly to her husband to open the door for her, but there was no reply, so she continued calling but still the door was closed and her husband didn't answer, so she put the bags down on the floor and opened the door herself, when she came in she saw her husband hanging on a rope, she was very frightened and thought to herself: who will do the washing, cleaning, cooking and everything now? She ran out and slipped down and fell from the stairs, the neighbors wanted to see what happened so they called an ambulance and took her to hospital. Her neighbor came in the apartment and saw the hanging man so she wanted to steal his money and put her hand in his pocket, then she screamed and ran out quickly, fell down and broke her leg. After she felt better, people asked her what happened and she said the she was a rope around the body of the man and he was moving. Actually the man was not really dead, he was just pretending because he wanted to see if his wife really loves him and what will be her reply if he will die.
