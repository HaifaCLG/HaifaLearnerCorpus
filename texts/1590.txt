In order that each one of us can be able to understand other people in different countries, and speak different language, we need to understand or to learn their language, it might seem easy but it’s not because in order to do that you need time and a lot of energy.


If anyone wants to learn a foreign language he must know that it’s hard, because he need to learn about the culture in which that language is spoken, so he can understand the roots of this language to make it more understandable for the person, because every language in the world has a past of its own that explains a lot of it.


So in order to study any foreign language there are few steps that everyone of us need to do, we must learn and swim deeper in the history and the past of it to seek its roots, and that will make the learning process easier, because once you know the past of the language, then you will be able to build your way into the strange words, and when you know the roots of each word then it won’t be hard for you to remember it.


Because the steps that everyone must do, then it will make the process of studying longer but useful too, because you will gain knowledge in the language itself and the history of it and the country that uses this language.


So we need a lot of time which is the most important thing in this case, and we need a lot of energy, and if we put these two important things together then we will manage to overcome every obstacle that might be lying ahead of us in the learning process.


After we gathered the information about the roots of the language then we will be able to continue the learning process that I think it’s the harder part, is practicing the spells of the language, in every language there are specific ways to spell the word, and this is the harder part which needs a lot of practice, and it won’t hurt to ask for help from someone that already have the knowledge in the language we are trying to learn, because each letter have a different spell in each language even though it can be written the same.


Sometime there are words that looks the same in two languages by spell differently and have a different meaning, and so it’s the part that needs time and practice, so sometimes it can take years to learn a foreign language, and after we give it the time that its need in the end we will harvest the price we worked for.


So even though it take time, and we might face a lot of hard things in order to learn a foreign language, but in the end it worth it, because after we manage to overcome the hard work, and overcome all the obstacles that may make things so confusing, in the end we will gain a lot, we will be able to speak a new language which will help us to communicate with new people, and we will gain a wide and amazing knowledge in the culture and history of other country, so in that way it always good for the people to go through this learning process, because even though there are a lot of work which won’t anyone who is ready to make the effort it needs, but in the end he will win a very important price which is enlarging their knowledge and the power to be able to face new things no matter what it cost.
