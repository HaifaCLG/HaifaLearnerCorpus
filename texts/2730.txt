My aunt's wedding - Two years ago I practicipated in my aunt's wedding. Im incapable to detail it as well, since I don't remember the morst of it.
At first, we arrived to the place. People were already there, and more guests arrived after us. For awhile, that was all. Then we all slowly got together aroudn the Chupa and waited for the "Happy couple" to arrive.
then of course the "fun" part came (You know, with the reading and blessing). th good thing? I stood in the Chupa.
Then... eating, dancing...more eating and more dancing.
The food and services were seved properly.
