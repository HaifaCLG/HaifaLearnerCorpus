My name is Dalit, I'm 23 years old, and I live in Israel. I'm the oldest child in my family, and I have one brother who is 19 years old. My brother’s name is Eliran, and he is in the army now. I was born in Israel in July 4th 1982. My mother Tami was born here too, and she is Yemenis. My father Ilan was born in France and he arrived to Israel when he was 16 years old.

My family and I are living in Netanya since I was born in a neighborhood name Dora. It is great city, because we have a lot of different attractions here. For example, we are five minutes away from a beautiful fine sanded beach. We are situated in the center of the country, on the coast line. I have friends who are from Netanya but because we are close to the main big city of Tel-Aviv, some of my friends are from there.

When I finished the army I went to do a make-up course because it used to be my hobby until I started studying at the "Seminar Ha Kibbutzim" college. I am a first year student in the English department to become a teacher.

I like to get out a lot on week ends, to dance in discos and pubs. I fund of “Black music” but I hear disco and Latin music too.
