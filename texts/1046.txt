It was a cold night and I was sitting with some other soldiers around the bonfire and talked about the good old days at school. I thought that school was really bad, but I suppose it could be much better as well. I told them about my history teacher. it was at my nine class. The history teacher who called Orli was the teacher I hated the most. Every time, at the minute that she entered the class she looked at me with a mean look and told me with a low voice get out of this class. This was the end of my history lessons every time. My parents try to told to her but she of course blamed me. When the test come I almost didn't know nothing, but I took the notebook of one of the good pupils and finished the material. At last i did the test and succeed very well. The teacher gave me 87 unwillingly.
