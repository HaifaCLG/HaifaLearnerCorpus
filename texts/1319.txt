When I was a little girl I used to think that my parents are the most embarrassing parents anyone could have.  When I walked with them in the street and they started to sign, I could die from embarrass.  And when they told their friends about my grades in school and about my private life I wanted to hide.  But all this were nothing comparing to what they did to me when I was 10 years old.  I had birthday and I invited my friends to celebrate with me.  We danced, and suddenly my parents also started to dance.  In front all my friends!  I couldn’t believe what I saw they were unfashionable and they certainly didn’t know how to dance.  My friends laughed but I didn’t.  I almost cried.  Now, when I grew up I’m not ashamed on my parents anymore and I’m less worry about their actions.  I just hope they won’t start to sing in the middle of the mall!

After what my parents did to me I was sad, embarrassed but most of all I was mad.  I was mad on my parents for done something like this to me.  I guess that the girl in the story more sadness than anger.  Her parents didn’t do that in purpose they just didn’t know how to act in a place like they were in.
