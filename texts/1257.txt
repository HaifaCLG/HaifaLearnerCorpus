Today, I finally finish my Bagrut exams.  I feel great to get this over with.  For the first time in 12 years I feel free to do what I want homeworks and tests.

On the other hand this is very sad for me to leave school and to leave my friends.  I hope that I’ll stay in touch with all of my friends but I know this is not going to happen.

I think that my life will change a lot.  Next year I’ll be on my own in the sherut leumi.  In my sherut I will not do any test.  I think I will have a lot of fun in this year.  After it I’ll go to the university to learn.  In the university I will have more tests than in my school.  The tests probably going to be longer and harder than the Bagrut examinations.

Enough with school talking!!!  I want to celebrate the fact that I finish my Bagrut examinations I plan to take a trip to Greece for a few day with my friends I think this is the best way to celebrate the end of the Bagrut exams.

In the end, I just want to say that I’m glad to be  after the exams but I’m sure that I will do more exams in the future.
