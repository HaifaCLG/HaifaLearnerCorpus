I got up in the morning and eat one slice of bread without anything. I had to be ready for the Judo championships for groups first fight. My partner didn't show up, I won a technical knock-out. The second fight was the same and at last at the third fight I had a partner my group won and we were at the fianl the other group were leading 3 -2 and then, the last fight I'm fight. The group were dependd on me and we began to fight but I lost, the group were disappointed ans so was I but second place is enough.
