The situation in Lebanon is very hard.  It’s hard to the people that live on the border and it’s hard to SDF that were taken as captives by Lebanon.  Now the people who live in the north that don’t have anybody to protect them from the terrorists.  I afraid that the Lebanese will come in the north and will do terror on the people.  After the residents of the north will surrender, and I’m sure it will happen, the Lebanon will come into Israel and will kill all of us and will take our country.  I’m happy for the soldiers that came home but I hate what Barak is doing. If we give back the

Golan. Then the terrorists will do more terror.
