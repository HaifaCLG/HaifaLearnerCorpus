Every day I eat 3 times each day.
At breakfast I eat bread. at lunch I eat meat and chips or spaggeti, and at dinner I eat something different each time.
In the weekend we eat Barbecue and maybe we're going to eat dinner at a restaurat.
I like the most to eat at differet restaurants in the country because almost each saturday we go to somewhere else.
