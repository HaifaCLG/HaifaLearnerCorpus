In new year weâ€™ve been at home, we invited my sister family.  My mother been in the kitchen for the rest of the day till dinner, and we my sister and myself cleaned the house.  My big brother went to Netanya to buy some groceries to my mother.

Then my sister  came with her girls, three beautiful nieces of mine.  When she came we made the table for the evening.

Then everybody got to shower everyone in his time.  And we started to got to the table to sit and to eat, we said blessing for the new year, and then for the rest of the holiday me and my sister Sara played with my nieces.

Shortly everything went very well.

PS:  My sister Zipi that in the army send her Shana tova to us in the phone because she is not at home.
