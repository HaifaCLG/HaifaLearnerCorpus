One day I woke up and I heard my mom talks. I thought that she talk about me when she said that have to go to a very far place. Then I took my bike and I started to ride, after a very long time I was couldn't keep ride becouse there was no side walk. THen I tied my bike and with the money I had I took a bus. Then I saw my mom and she was very surprised. Then she explayn me everything and then I understood that on the phone she talked with someone who wanted to buy her car. She was laf, and was laf too.
