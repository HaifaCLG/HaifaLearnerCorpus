Hi...!
Remember my birthday?
My parents give me 2,000$! Now I can to buy PS3! It's a lot of fun! All my friend come to my home only for to play on it! It's a special consle you know...
But, I dont tell you the all, my grandparents give PS3's discs, and psp's discs.
I am can to be the "king of the class", because I am friendly and I have 2 speical consles!
I am the happy child on the world!
