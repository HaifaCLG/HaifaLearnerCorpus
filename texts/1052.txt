My name is <NAME OMITTED> and I living in Tel Aviv right now. I am 27 years old. One day when I walk in the street one woman stopped me suddenly ans asked me my name. I answer to her and she said I recognized you from some where. I asked her for her name and she said my name is yael. I remember and I said maybe we were in the army together. She asked me were I was in the army and I said I served in the paratrooper and she said that she served in the navy. Then we start from the beginning and then I tried to remember may be in school we were together. She asked were you learned and I answer in Tel aviv and she said me too. Then I remembered she was me best friend is school and all this years I tried to fined her and now in the big city I fined her. We hugged each other and I invited her to my apartment and we drink together coffee and we remembering the good old days at school. what we have done to the teachers how we scared the biology teacher how we copy in some test and the test in English teacher catch us and she took the papers and tore it then we dispelled and how we meet every week and take about many thinks not just on school.
