A few months ago a 16 year old girl was stabbed in a  junction right outside her village by an Arab.

The girl and 4 other friends have decided to walk outside her village which was located in the settlements in order to advertise something to may people as possible.

The Arab stabbed her right in the back and she fell down immediately, and the ambulance took her straight to the hospital.  She was rescued.

This kind of violence is common in the settlements.  I am not sure the government is doing enough to prevent it.  In an area like the settlements where people throw rocks at other people and the police doesnâ€™t do anything about it no wonder things that are more dangerous like stabbing happen to.  In a delicate area like this there should be more control over the people.
