I love my mother as much as I love my father even that my father doesn't live with me and my mother (and my bigger brother too) my parents are divorced.


When I was 3,5 my parents divorced. Now my father married a second wife and 3 children were born to them (their age : 6,5, 4,5, 3 months).


One day when I had a problem with my mother and my father talked with me, my father's wife talked with me too and she told me that she has the same problem. My mother and my father and his wife helped me with this problem. Together we solved the problem. They showed me that they love me even if I have a very big problem, and they showed me that they wanted to help me anytime, because at this time my father's wife was in her 9th month to her pregnancy. The relationship between me, my brother (from my father and mother) and my father's wife is good, she sometimes shouts but she loves us. My father and my mother don't talk, and my mother and my father didn't compete  Between them.


My life is happy and I hope that it will go on like this.
