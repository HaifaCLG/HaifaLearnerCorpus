Dear Dani
Hello. How are you. if you ask How I than I am very good.
Two weeks ago was my birthday and I got 2,000 shekels from my lovely friend Shiran.
Until now I spent 1,000 shekel on clothes, shoes, make up and stuff like that.
It was vrry fan to buy all this things.
1,000 shekels left to me and mo mother suggested me to save this money and put it on the bank.
I don't know what to do cause I want to buy mp4 but from the other hand my mother is right.
Fainly I think that I will listen to my mother and put this money on the bank but I am not sure.
What would you do if you were me?
I wand you to write me your anser.
Love
