Dear Offir,
I want to tell you about an amazing thing that happend to me this week. As you know I had a birthday 4 days ago, My grand mother gave me 4 million israeli shekels! I was shocked when I saw that. I asked her Hodoe's she get that amount of money? She told me that she won the loto last week and she won the prize of 50 million shekels.
Now I love my grand mother even more.
Yesterday I went to the shopping sentre and bought all the clothes in the LGGBRDtnt store now i'm living like a king and i can spend the money for everything that I want.
My parents want's that I will invest the money in the "Bursa' but I want to enjoy the life and spend the money for the things that I want.
I want to ask you a question.
What would you do if you were me?
