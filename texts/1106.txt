Once I was told by someone from my family about something that happened a lot of time ago. Something when the British were still in our country. Something that made the other Arab statement around us scared. It happened about 50 years ago. My village is surrounded by Arab settlements and always has been. My village was still young and there were not many people in it. Someday the men from my village has gone to work in the fields. In the village there ware just women and little children. Suddenly my village was attack. No body was hurt, but the Arabs stole all our cattle has been stolen. The men had come back from work. They saw what happened and decided to go and search it in the villages next to us that ware Arabs. After they decided to do it they had gone to the villages, to search the stolen cattle. After they could not find it they had waited until the Arabs ware gone to work and then our people stole all there cattle. The Arabs gone to the British and told them that our people had stolen our cattle. The British asked us to give back the hidden cattle to the Arabs and got us back our cattle but not before we warned the Arabs that if they try to mess with our people one more time, the cattle would not be the only one to get hurt. Since then the Arabs don't mess with us, but then there are the young Arabs men that do not no this story and don't afraid from us.
