 "2": "Most students enjoy the long stretch of summer vacation, but some parents and educators feel that two months is too long a break from school.

 "4": "Some countries allow people to get a driver's license at the age of 16.

 "10": "In 2010, women earned just 18% of computer science degrees in U.S., down from 37% in 1985, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology. Analysts say the low numbers are partly because girls are not encouraged to pursue science as often or as enthusiastically as boys. Dr. Cheryan, a psychology professor, theorizes that this decline might be partly attributable to the rise of pop-culture portrayals of scientists as white or Asian male geeks in movies and TV shows like \"Revenge of the Nerds\" and \"The Big Bang Theory\". Why do you think more women and girls aren't pursuing careers in computing and tech fields? Do you think the problem is that parents, teachers and society in general do not encourage girls to enter these fields?",

According to the survey conducted by Tinder and Bohlander (2011), 95% of the students bring their phone to class every day, and 92% use their phone to text message during class time. The majority of the students also admitted they used their phones for browsing, sending pictures and accessing social networks during classes.2. Lee, Kim, McDonough, Mendoza and Kim (2017) conducted an experiment in which students were divided into three groups: (1) cell phone usage allowed, (2) cell phone possession allowed but without usage, (3) cell phones removed. All participants attended a 20-minute lecture and were sent text messages during the lecture to mimic classroom distractions. After the lecture, all three groups took a multiple-choice test on the material they learned. The participants who had their cell phone taken away performed significantly better on the test than the two other groups.",
